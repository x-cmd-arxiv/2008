traced by SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies. The potential decays on large scales due
to cosmic acceleration, leaving an imprint on cosmic microwave background (CMB)
radiation through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. With a template fit,
we directly measure this signature on the CMB at a 2-sigma confidence level.
The measurement is consistent with the cross-correlation statistic,
strengthening the claim that dark energy is indeed the cause of the
correlation. This new approach potentially simplifies the cosmological
interpretation. Our constructed linear ISW map shows no evidence for
degree-scale cold and hot spots associated with supervoid and supercluster
structures. This suggests that the linear ISW effect in a concordance
Lambda-CDM cosmology is insufficient to explain the strong CMB imprints from
these structures that we previously reported.

This is consistent with light gravitinos, with masses constrained by an upper

is compatible with axinos with a mass of about 1 GeV and a very low reheating

favours regions with a low value of tan(beta), for which the neutralino-stau

range of pseudorapidity ($\eta$) and azimuthal angle ($\phi$) as a function of

coverage for inclusive charged particles, which allows for the study of
correlations on both long- and short-range scales. A complex two-dimensional
correlation structure in $\Delta \eta$ and $\Delta \phi$ emerges, which is
interpreted in the context of a cluster model. The effective cluster size and
decay width are extracted from the two-particle pseudorapidity correlation
functions. The effective cluster size found in semi-central Cu+Cu and Au+Au
collisions is comparable to that found in proton-proton collisions but a
non-trivial decrease of the size with increasing centrality is observed.
Moreover, a comparison between results from Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions shows an
interesting scaling of the effective cluster size with the measured fraction of
total cross section (which is related to the ratio of the impact parameter to
the nuclear radius, $b/2R$), suggesting a geometric origin. Further analysis
for pairs from restricted azimuthal regions shows that the effective cluster
size at $\Delta\phi \sim 180^{\circ}$ drops more rapidly toward central
collisions than the size at $\Delta\phi \sim 0^{\circ}$. The effect of limited
$\eta$ acceptance on the cluster parameters is also addressed, and a correction
is applied to present cluster parameters for full $\eta$ coverage, leading to
much larger effective cluster sizes and widths than previously noted in the

flows to drive turbulence in gaseous disks at $z=2$. The increase of gas mass
through cold flows is by itself not sufficient to increase the star formation
rate sufficiently to recover the number density of $\dot{M}_*>120$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ galaxies in our model. In addition, it is necessary to increase the
star formation efficiency. This can be achieved naturally in the porosity
model, where star formation efficiency scales $\propto \sigma$, which scales as
cloud velocity dispersion. As cold accretion is the main driver for gas
velocity dispersion in our model, star formation efficiency parallels cold
accretion rates, and allows fast conversion into stars. At $z\sim 2$, we find a
space density $~10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ in star-forming galaxies with

regular, but the equation is singular because $z (U)$ can attain the value 0.
We focus on a small enough neighbourhood of a point $\bar U$ satisfying $F(\bar

the study of hyperbolic-parabolic systems this means restricting to systems
with small total variation. We discuss how to extend the notions of center

  1. An adversarial scheduler that can select both participants to the game can
preclude the system from reaching the unique fixed point on most graph

leads to poles of the scattering matrix corresponding to bound states or
resonances. We show that 11 states (either bound or resonant) get dynamically
generated in nine strangeness-isospin-spin channels. Five of them can be
identified with those reported in the PDG, i.e., the $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1710)$,
$f_2(1270)$, $f'_2(1525)$, and $K^*_2(1430)$. The masses of the latter three
tensor states have been used to fine-tune the free parameters of the unitary
approach, i.e., the subtraction constants in evaluating the vector meson
-vector meson loop functions in the dimensional regularization scheme. The
branching ratios of these five dynamically generated states are found to be
consistent with data. The existence of the other six states should be taken as
predictions to be tested by future experiments.

we formulate and prove a real analogue of Toda's theorem. Unlike Toda's proof
in the discrete case, which relied on sophisticated combinatorial arguments,
our proof is topological in nature. As a consequence of our techniques we are
also able to relate the computational hardness of two extremely well-studied
problems in algorithmic semi-algebraic geometry -- namely the problem of
deciding sentences in the first order theory of the reals with a constant
number of quantifier alternations, and that of computing Betti numbers of
semi-algebraic sets. We obtain a polynomial time reduction of the compact

new calibration and spectral shape measurements with the HdM detectors.
GENIUS-TF was a test-facility that verified the feasibility of using bare
germanium detectors in liquid nitrogen. The first year results of this
experiment are discussed. The GERDA experiment has been designed to further
increase the sensitivity by operating bare germanium detectors in a high purity
cryogenic liquid, which simultaneously serves as a shielding against background
and as a cooling media. In the preparatory stage of GERDA, an external
background gamma flux measurement was done at the experimental site in the Hall
A of the Gran Sasso laboratory. The characterization of the enriched detectors
from the HdM and IGEX experiments was performed in the underground detector
laboratory for the GERDA collaboration. Long term stability measurements of a
bare HPGe detector in liquid argon were carried out. Based on these

that two distinct mechanisms govern the atomic dynamics: the finite,

redistribution. At low input probe intensities, the residual Doppler width of
the atoms, combined with the finite atomic response time, result in a linear,
transient hysteretic effect that modifies the locations, widths, and magnitudes
of the resulting gain spectra depending on the sign of the scan chirp. When
larger intensities (\textit{i.e.}, greater than a few $\mu$W/cm$^2$) are
incident on the atomic sample for several $\mu$s, hole-burning in the atomic
sample's momentum distribution leads to a coherent population redistribution
that persists for approximately 100 $\mu$s. We propose using RIRs to engineer
the atomic momentum distribution to enhance the nonlinear atom-photon coupling.

in some other long-duration GRBs. The latest observations are dominated by
light from the host and show that the GRB took place in a faint dwarf galaxy
(r(AB)\approx27.0, rest-frame M_B\approx-17.2). This galaxy is small even by
the standards of other GRB hosts, which is suggestive of a low metallicity
environment. Intriguingly, the properties of this extreme event - a small host
and bright supernova - are entirely typical of the very low-luminosity bursts
such as GRB980425 and GRB060218.

into all spheres of life. Therefore a closer look at the impact of ICT in
public financial management and performance is highly justified. Public finance
is defined as a field of economics concerned with paying for collective or
governmental activities, and with the administration and design of those
activities. Activities will be viewed as services or more precisely as public
services. We believe that there is need to consider performance from the
perspective of effective performance and the perceived performance. In fact the
real or effective performance might not correspond to the perceived
performance. A service can be considered from the perspective of the
decision-maker, who in our case could be a government or a collectivity. ICT
can be employed in the three phases that concern the decision-maker: design,
implementation and evaluation. The beneficiaries of a service can employ ICT in
any of the three phases - awareness, exploitation and assessment - for
guarantying a high level of efficiency. Each phase in the environment of a
service will be presented as well as illustrations of how ICT can be employed
in order to improve the end-result of each one of them. We believe that a high
efficiency of each phase will produce a high global efficiency. It should be
noted however that the effectiveness of any system is highly dependent on the
human engagement in the system. Therefore, the impact of ICT in public
financial management will be felt only if the decision-makers and the end-users
of the services engage themselves in the success of the system. Instead of
giving a catalog of services, the focus has been on the model (or methodology)
to adopt in designing services for which ICT could enhance the implementation.

show that the fraction of active stars decreases as a function of vertical
distance from the Galactic plane (a statistical proxy for age), and that the
magnitude of this decrease changes significantly for different M spectral
types. Adopting a simple dynamical model for thin disk vertical heating, we
assign an age for the activity decline at each spectral type, and thus
determine the activity lifetimes for M dwarfs. In addition, we derive a
statistical age-activity relation for each spectral type using the dynamical

luminosity of each star (the latter of which also decreases with vertical
height above the Galactic plane).

supermassive black hole mass for a large sample of nearby galaxies drawn from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We demonstrate that there are two distinct
regimes of black hole growth in nearby galaxies. The first is associated with
galaxies with significant star formation in their central kiloparsec regions,
and is characterized by a broad log-normal distribution of accretion rates
peaked at about one percent of the Eddington limit. In this regime, the
Eddington ratio distribution is independent of the mass of the black hole and
shows no further dependence on the central stellar population of the galaxy.
The second regime is associated with galaxies with old central stellar
populations, and is characterized by a power-law distribution function of
Eddington ratios. In this regime, the time-averaged mass accretion rate onto
black holes is proportional to the mass of stars in the galaxy bulge, with a
constant of proportionality that depends on the mean stellar age of the stars.
This result is once again independent of black hole mass. We show that both the
slope of the power-law and the decrease in the accretion rate onto black holes
in old galaxies are consistent with population synthesis model predictions of
the decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of mean stellar age. Our
results lead to a very simple picture of black hole growth in the local
Universe. If the supply of cold gas in a galaxy bulge is plentiful, the black
hole regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further depend on the
properties of the interstellar medium. Once the gas runs out, black hole growth
is regulated by the rate at which evolved stars lose their mass.

obtained by combining the predicted history of star formation and mass
accretion with the physics of stellar evolution through stellar population
models. In the recent literature, significant differences have emerged
regarding the implementation of the Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch
phase of stellar evolution. The emission in the TP-AGB phase dominates the
bolometric and near-IR spectrum of intermediate-age (~1 Gyr) stellar
populations, hence it is crucial for the correct modeling of the galaxy
luminosities and colours. In this paper for the first time, we incorporate a
full prescription of the TP-AGB phase in a semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation. We find that the inclusion of the TP-AGB in the model spectra
dramatically alters the predicted colour-magnitude relation and its evolution
with redshift. When the TP-AGB phase is active, the rest-frame V-K galaxy
colours are redder by almost 2 magnitudes in the redshift range z~2-3 and by 1
magnitude at z~1. Very red colours are produced in disk galaxies, so that the
V-K colour distributions of disk and spheroids are virtually undistinguishable
at low redshifts. We also find that the galaxy K-band emission is more than 1
magnitude higher in the range z~1-3. This may alleviate the difficulties met by
the hierarchical clustering scenario in predicting the red galaxy population at
high redshifts. The comparison between simulations and observations have to be
revisited in the light of our results.

consistent with the age of Be stars. We also examine the ""overabundance"" of
Be-XRBs in the SMC fields covered by Chandra, in comparison with the Galaxy. In
luminosities down to about 10^{34} erg/s, we find that SMC Be-XRBs are 1.5
times more common when compared to the Milky Way even after taking into account
the difference in the formation rates of OB stars. This residual excess can be
attributed to the lower metallicity of the SMC. Finally, we find that the
mixing of Be-XRBs with other than their natal stellar population is not an
issue in our comparisons of Be-XRBs and stellar populations in the SMC.
Instead, we find indication for variation of the SMC XRB populations on
kiloparsec scales, related to local variations of the formation rate of OB
stars and slight variation of their age, which results in different relative
numbers of Be stars and therefore XRBs.

technology, the economy, and science itself: Interactions within and between
organisms change; transportation patterns by air, land, and sea all change; the
global financial flow changes; and the frontiers of scientific research change.
Networks and clustering methods have become important tools to comprehend
instances of these large-scale structures, but without methods to distinguish
between real trends and noisy data, these approaches are not useful for
studying how networks change. Only if we can assign significance to the
partitioning of single networks can we distinguish meaningful structural
changes from random fluctuations. Here we show that bootstrap resampling
accompanied by significance clustering provides a solution to this problem. To
connect changing structures with the changing function of networks, we
highlight and summarize the significant structural changes with alluvial
diagrams and realize de Solla Price's vision of mapping change in science:
studying the citation pattern between about 7000 scientific journals over the
past decade, we find that neuroscience has transformed from an
interdisciplinary specialty to a mature and stand-alone discipline.

would need to consider the role of ""overlapping communities."" Despite some
efforts in this direction, the problem of detecting overlapping groups remains
unsolved because there is neither a formal definition of overlapping community,
nor an ensemble of networks with which to test the performance of group
detection algorithms when nodes can belong to more than one group. Here, we
introduce an ensemble of networks with overlapping groups. We then apply three
group identification methods--modularity maximization, k-clique percolation,
and modularity-landscape surveying--to these networks. We find that the
modularity-landscape surveying method is the only one able to detect
heterogeneities in node memberships, and that those heterogeneities are only
detectable when the overlap is small. Surprisingly, we find that the k-clique
percolation method is unable to detect node membership for the overlapping

  for Delay-Sensitive Applications","30 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.MM cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a general cross-layer optimization framework in
which we explicitly consider both the heterogeneous and dynamically changing
characteristics of delay-sensitive applications and the underlying time-varying
network conditions. We consider both the independently decodable data units
(DUs, e.g. packets) and the interdependent DUs whose dependencies are captured
by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We first formulate the cross-layer design as
a non-linear constrained optimization problem by assuming complete knowledge of
the application characteristics and the underlying network conditions. The
constrained cross-layer optimization is decomposed into several cross-layer
optimization subproblems for each DU and two master problems. The proposed
decomposition method determines the necessary message exchanges between layers
for achieving the optimal cross-layer solution. However, the attributes (e.g.
distortion impact, delay deadline etc) of future DUs as well as the network
conditions are often unknown in the considered real-time applications. The
impact of current cross-layer actions on the future DUs can be characterized by
a state-value function in the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. Based on
the dynamic programming solution to the MDP, we develop a low-complexity
cross-layer optimization algorithm using online learning for each DU
transmission. This online algorithm can be implemented in real-time in order to
cope with unknown source characteristics, network dynamics and resource
constraints. Our numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
online algorithm.

Levy defects and Fischer speckles, the classical mathematical proof [D. A.
Darling, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 73, 95 (1952)] for the existence and the

with strong contrast, and to explain the characteristic lengths for the main

show that a number of generic features thought to govern fibril assembly are
present in the toy model. The monomer, which contains eight beads made from
three letters (hydrophobic, polar, and charged), adopts a compact conformation
in the native state. The kinetics of fibril assembly occurs in three distinct
stages. In each stage there is a cascade of events that transforms the monomers
and oligomers to ordered structures. In the first ""burst"" stage highly mobile
oligomers of varying sizes form. The conversion to the aggregation-prone
conformation occurs within the oligomers during the second stage. As time
progresses, a dominant cluster emerges that contains a majority of the chains.
In the final stage, the aggregation-prone conformation particles serve as a
template onto which smaller oligomers or monomers can dock and undergo
conversion to fibril structures. The overall time for growth in the latter
stages is well described by the Lifshitz-Slyazov growth kinetics for
crystallization from super-saturated solutions.

unary NFA can be represented as a union of arithmetic progressions that is at
most quadratically large. We propose a correction for this and show how
Martinez's polynomial time algorithm, which realizes Chrobak's theorem, can be
made correct accordingly. We also show that Martinez's algorithm cannot be
improved to have logarithmic space, unless L = NL.

framework for introducing multivariate Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials. Their
main properties are established in this setting: generating and determinantal
formulae, difference equations. As an application we consider the problem of
evaluating moments related to a multivariate Barnes type integral involving the
Harish-Chandra $c$-function of a symmetric cone.

satisfy the relativity principle and whose kinematics can be formulated
employing reference frames of the type usually adopted in special relativity.
Such mechanics allow for the presence of anisotropy, both conventional (due to
non-standard synchronisation protocols) and real (leading to detectable
chronogeometrical effects, independent of the choice of synchronisation). We
give a general method for finding the fundamental dynamical quantities
(Lagrangian, energy and momentum), and write their explicit expression in all
the kinematics compatible with the basic requirements. We also write the
corresponding dispersion relations and outline a formulation of these theories
in terms of a pseudo-Finslerian spacetime geometry. Although the treatment is
restricted to the case of one spatial dimension, an extension to three
dimensions is almost straightforward.

  British Astronomical Association",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  SDSS J162718.39+120435.0 was suspected of being a dwarf nova from
spectroscopic observations made available by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
Photometry conducted during the 2008 outburst, the first ever outburst of this
object detected and followed up in real time, shows that the outburst reached
magnitude 14.6 at maximum, had an amplitude of 4.6 magnitudes and lasted for at
least 18 days. Common superhumps were detected with an amplitude of up to 0.4
magnitudes, confirming it to be a member of the SU UMa family. Initially the
superhump period, Psh, was 0.10993(7) days (2.638 hours), but it subsequently
reduced to Psh = 0.10890(9) days (2.614 hours) later in the outburst. The
period change corresponds to the end of the plateau period of the outburst. The
orbital period, Porb, was estimated from the two Psh values as between 0.1026 d
and 0.1016 d, which places SDSS1627 near the centre of the period gap in the
orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variables.
