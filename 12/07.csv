superconductors came with the demonstration that the interaction was retarded
and that the corresponding energy scales were associated with phonons. Using
cellular dynamical mean-field theory for the two-dimensional Hubbard model, we
identify such retardation effects in d-wave pairing and associate the
corresponding energy scales with short-range spin fluctuations. We find which
frequencies are relevant for pairing as a function of interaction strength and
doping and show that the disappearance of superconductivity on the overdoped
side coincides with the disappearance of the low energy feature in the
antiferromagnetic fluctuations, as observed in neutron scattering experiments.

spinors. The typical examples are supersymmetric supergravity backgrounds;
although there are more classical instances of this construction. We focus on
two results: the geometric constructions of compact real forms of the simple
Lie algebras of type B_4, F_4 and E_8 from S^7, S^8 and S^15, respectively; and
the construction of the Killing superalgebra of eleven-dimensional supergravity

derived on the basis of a quasi-monochromatic wave theory. Traces of matrix

as transverse position operators for macroscopic bodies. An effective quantum
wave equation for spacetime is derived from the Matrix Hamiltonian. Its
solutions display eigenmodes that connect longitudinal separation and
transverse position operators on macroscopic scales. Measurements of transverse
relative positions of macroscopically separated bodies, such as signals in
Michelson interferometers, are shown to display holographic nonlocality,
indeterminacy and noise, whose properties can be predicted with no parameters
except $R$. Similar results are derived using a detailed scattering calculation
of the matrix wavefunction. Current experimental technology will allow a
definitive and precise test or validation of this interpretation of holographic
fundamental theories. In the latter case, they will yield a direct measurement
of $R$ independent of the gravitational definition of the Planck length, and a

describe the time evolution of the MRCA age in $(1+\beta)$-stable continuous

Our models are non-axisymmetric and carried out using the thin-disc
approximation. Self-gravity plays an important role in the early evolution of a
disc, and the later evolution is determined by the relative importance of
gravitational and viscous torques. In the absence of viscous torques, a
protostellar disc evolves into a self-regulated state with disk-averaged Toomre
parameter Q \sim 1.5-2.0, non-axisymmetric structure diminishing with time, and
maximum disc-to-star mass ratio \xi = 0.14. We estimate an effective viscosity
parameter \alpha_eff associated with gravitational torques at the inner
boundary of our simulation to be in the range 10^{-4}-10^{-3} during the late
evolution. Addition of viscous torques with a low value \alpha = 10^{-4} has
little effect on the evolution, structure, and accretion properties of the
disc, and the self-regulated state is largely preserved. A sequence of
increasing values of \alpha results in the discs becoming more axisymmetric in
structure, being more gravitationally stable, having greater accretion rates,
larger sizes, shorter lifetimes, and lower disc-to-star mass ratios. For
\alpha=10^{-2}, the model is viscous-dominated and the self-regulated state
largely disappears by late times. (Abridged)

different directions. The mathematical problem is then estimating a
multivariate function from its line integrals.

of Statistics called copula. Shortly copulas are functions that link
multivariate distributions to theirs univariate marginal functions. It appeared
that copulas captivated all dependence structure concerning the marginal
functions and offer a wide range of parametric family model which could be used
as a model for the joint distribution function. This statistical problem is the
same as in Tomography, because a marginal density is obtained from a line
integral of its joint distribution. In the particular case of only given
horizontal and vertical projections corresponding to a given two marginal
functions, we link the theory of copula to tomography via the Radon transform

Universality in this context is defined as the validity to fully characterize
the system in terms of two-body scattering length. We discuss universality in
the following three contexts: closed-channel dominated Feshbach resonance,
Efimov physics near Feshbach resonances, and corrections to the mean field
energy of Bose-Einstein condensates with large scattering lengths. Novel
experimental tools and strategies are discussed to study universality in
ultracold atomic gases: dynamic control of interactions, run-away evaporative
cooling in optical traps, and preparation of few-body systems in optical
lattices.

the partition function of a minimal model. A family of models constructed via

remains flat. When a block of biological soft tissue is subjected to large
shear, it is likely that its surface in the plane of shear will buckle
(apparition of wrinkles). One factor that distinguishes soft tissues from
rubber-like solids is the presence -- sometimes visible to the naked eye -- of
oriented collagen fibre bundles, which are stiffer than the elastin matrix into
which they are embedded but are nonetheless flexible and extensible. Here we
show that the simplest model of isotropic nonlinear elasticity, namely the
incompressible neo-Hookean model, suffers surface instability in shear only at
tremendous amounts of shear, i.e., above 3.09, which corresponds to a 72
degrees angle of shear. Next we incorporate a family of parallel fibres in the
model and show that the resulting solid can be either reinforced or strongly
weakened with respect to surface instability, depending on the angle between
the fibres and the direction of shear, and depending on the ratio E/mu between
the stiffness of the fibres and that of the matrix. For this ratio we use
values compatible with experimental data on soft tissues. Broadly speaking, we
find that the surface becomes rapidly unstable when the shear takes place
""against"" the fibres, and that as E/mu increases, so does the sector of angles
where early instability is expected to occur.

difference in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of ionizing sources.
Powerful young radio-loud (YRL) AGNs favor SED without a strong big blue bump,
i.e., a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF), while RQ AGNs are
consistent with the models adopting SED with a strong big blue bump, i.e., a
geometrically thin, optically thick disk. These findings imply that the
formation of powerful AGN jets requires the accretion disk with harder ionizing
SED (i.e., a RIAF). We discuss the obscuring structure of YRL AGNs as a

obtained towards three M-type AGB stars using the Odin satellite. This provides
additional strong constrains on the properties of circumstellar H2O and the
circumstellar envelope. Methods: ISO and Odin satellite H2O line data are used
as constraints for radiative transfer models. Special consideration is taken to
the spectrally resolved Odin line profiles, and the effect of excitation to the
first excited vibrational states of the stretching modes (nu1=1 and nu3=1) on
the derived abundances is estimated. A non-local, radiative transfer code based
on the ALI formalism is used. Results: The H2O abundance estimates are in
agreement with previous estimates. The inclusion of the Odin data sets stronger
constraints on the size of the H2O envelope. The H2O(1_10 - 1_01) line profiles
require a significant reduction in expansion velocity compared to the terminal
gas expansion velocity determined in models of CO radio line emission,
indicating that the H2O emission lines probe a region where the wind is still
being accelerated. Including the nu3=1 state significantly lowers the estimated
abundances for the low-mass-loss-rate objects. This shows the importance of
detailed modelling, in particular the details of the infrared spectrum in the
range 3 to 6 micron, to estimate accurate circumstellar H2O abundances.
Conclusions: Spectrally resolved circumstellar H2O emission lines are important
probes of the physics and chemistry in the inner regions of circumstellar
envelopes around asymptotic giant branch stars. Predictions for H2O emission
lines in the spectral range of the upcoming Herschel/HIFI mission indicate that
these observations will be very important in this context.

$k[G/U]^{U'}$ is a polynomial algebra of Krull dimension $2r$, where $r=rk(G)$.
A related result is that, for any simple finite-dimensional $G$-module $V$,
$V^{U'}$ is a cyclic $U/U'$-module.
  Second, we study ""symmetries"" of Poincare series for $U'$-invariants on
affine conical $G$-varieties.
  Third, we obtain a classification of simple $G$-modules $V$ with polynomial
algebras of $U'$-invariants (for $G$ simple).

For given subsets $\Sigma(v)$ of neighbours of $v$, for every $v\in V(G)$, this
is a proper colouring of the vertices of $G$ such that, in addition, vertices
that appear together in some $\Sigma(v)$ receive different colours. This
concept generalises the notion of colouring the square of graphs and of cyclic
colouring of graphs embedded in a surface. We prove a general result for graphs
embeddable in a fixed surface, which implies asymptotic versions of Wegner's
and Borodin's Conjecture on the planar version of these two colourings. Using a
recent approach of Havet et al., we reduce the problem to edge-colouring of
multigraphs, and then use Kahn's result that the list chromatic index is close
to the fractional chromatic index.
  Our results are based on a strong structural lemma for graphs embeddable in a
fixed surface, which also implies that the size of a clique in the square of a
graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ embeddable in some fixed surface is at most
$\frac32\,\Delta$ plus a constant.

with the appearance of an skewed Fe line is detected during one of the

XMM/EPIC-pn, JEM-X, ISGRI and SPI data were fit with the hybrid
thermal/non-thermal Comptonization model (EQPAIR). With this model a
non-thermal component seems to be required by the data in all the observations.

being the transition from a compact corona in the first observation to the
disappearance of coronal material in the second and re-appearance in the third.

is caused by the growth of the cross-sectional area of the cocoon head.
Moreover, by comparing the hot spot speed with the sound speed of the ambient
