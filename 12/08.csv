mathematical structure with which to formulate physical theories. In particular
it has been used to reformulate standard quantum mechanics in such a way that a
novel type of logic is used to represent propositions. In this paper we extend
this formulation to include temporally-ordered collections of propositions as
opposed to single-time propositions. That is to say, we have developed a
quantum history formalism in the language of topos theory where truth values
can be assigned to temporal propositions. We analyse the extent to which such
truth values can be derived from the truth values of the constituent,
single-time propositions.

well-studied problems of Distributed Algorithms. Starting with the work of Cole
and Vishkin in 86, there was a long line of gradually improving algorithms
published. The current state-of-the-art running time is O(Delta log Delta +
log^* n), due to Kuhn and Wattenhofer, PODC'06. Linial (FOCS'87) has proved a
lower bound of 1/2 \log^* n for the problem, and Szegedy and Vishwanathan
(STOC'93) provided a heuristic argument that shows that algorithms from a wide
family of locally iterative algorithms are unlikely to achieve running time
smaller than \Theta(Delta log Delta).
  We present a deterministic (Delta + 1)-coloring distributed algorithm with
running time O(Delta) + 1/2 log^* n. We also present a tradeoff between the
running time and the number of colors, and devise an O(Delta * t)-coloring
algorithm with running time O(Delta / t + \log^* n), for any parameter t, 1 < t
< Delta^{1-epsilon}, for an arbitrarily small constant epsilon, 0 < epsilon <

  On the way to this result we study a generalization of the notion of graph
coloring, which is called defective coloring. In an m-defective p-coloring the
vertices are colored with p colors so that each vertex has up to m neighbors
with the same color. We show that an m-defective p-coloring with reasonably
small m and p can be computed very efficiently. We also develop a technique to
employ multiple defect colorings of various subgraphs of the original graph G
for computing a (Delta+1)-coloring of G. We believe that these techniques are
of independent interest.

distortion, past light cone space gradient, and galaxy biasing, and to
calibrate the baryon oscillation scale and the genus topology. For example, we
predict from our mock surveys that the baryon acoustic oscillation peak scale

the SDSS-III sample is divided into three equal volume shells, or about 2.6%

correct the scale for the systematic effects amounting up to 5.2% to use it to
constrain the linear theories. And the uncertainty in the amplitude of the

and cluster-rich spirals are statistically indistinguishable. An Mc=2.1x10^5
Msun Schechter function also fits the MF of young clusters in the Large
Magellanic Cloud. If the same ICMF applies in the Milky Way, a bound cluster
with M>10^5 Msun will form about once every 10 Myr, while an M>10^6 Msun
cluster will form only once every 50 Gyr. Luminosity functions (LFs) of model
cluster populations drawn from an Mc=2.1x10^5 Msun Schechter ICMF generally
agree with LFs observed in spiral galaxies. It is thus concluded that the ICMF
in present-day spiral discs can be modelled as a Schechter function with Mc =
200,000 Msun. However, the presence of significant numbers of M>10^6 Msun (and
even M>10^7 Msun) clusters in some starburst galaxies makes it unlikely that
the Mc value derived for spirals is universal. In high-pressure environments,
such as those created by complex gas kinematics and feedback in mergers, Mc can
shift to higher masses than in quiescent discs.

this value of z for extragalactic scenarios. We cannot rule out any of these

tidal disruption of a CO white dwarf (WD) by an intermediate-mass black hole

the presence of a strong disk wind that was not included in previous numerical
simulations. If the IMBH is the central BH of a galaxy, this explains the non
detection of a bright galaxy in the direction of SCP 06F6. Our second favorite
scenario is a type Ia-like SN that exploded inside the dense wind of a carbon
star. The carbon star is the donor star of the exploded WD. Our third favorite
model is a Galactic source of an asteroid that collided with a WD. Such a
scenario was discussed in the past as the source of dusty disks around WDs, but
no predictions exist regarding the appearance of such an event. Our least
favorite model is of a core collapse SN. The only way we can account for the
properties of SCP 06F6 with a core collapse SN is if we assume the occurrence

  Based on an ON/OFF continuous-time Markov chain model, the optimal allocation
of power and transmission time is formulated as a convex optimization problem

the case where the infrastructure channel is random and rate constraints need
only be met in the long-term average. Finally, the multi-terminal case is

1580 resolved star clusters using SSP models. This data is combined with data
on the spatially resolved star formation rates and gas surface densities, as
well as Halpha and 20cm radio-continuum (RC) emission, which allows us to study
the spatial correlations between star formation and star clusters. Two-point
autocorrelation functions are used to study the clustering of star clusters as
a function of spatial scale and age. Results. We find that the clustering of
star clusters among themselves decreases both with spatial scale and age,
consistent with hierarchical star formation. The slope of the autocorrelation
functions are consistent with projected fractal dimensions in the range of
1.2-1.6, which is similar to other galaxies, therefore suggesting that the
fractal dimension of hierarchical star formation is universal. Both star and
cluster formation peak at a galactocentric radius of 2.5 and 5 kpc, which we
tentatively attribute to the presence of the 4:1 resonance and the co-rotation
radius. The positions of the youngest (<10 Myr) star clusters show the
strongest correlation with the spiral arms, Halpha, and the RC emission, and
these correlations decrease with age. The azimuthal distribution of clusters in
terms of kinematic age away from the spiral arms indicates that the majority of
the clusters formed 5-20 Myr before their parental gas cloud reached the centre

self-assembled semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are very sensitive to the
geometry and chemical composition of the QDs, and are random from dots to dots.
However, in this letter, we show through analytical and numerical methods that
the transition energies of the exciton complexes in self-assembled quantum dots
and rings follow a simple and robust rule, i.e., the sum of exciton and
biexciton transition energies minus the transition energies of trions is always
positive and almost a constant for the same type of quantum dots and rings as a
consequence of a pure Coulomb correlation effect. More interestingly, this
quantity show a sharp transition when the topology change from a dot to a ring.
This {\it hidden} correlation effect, directly measurable in experiments,
offers a useful way to understand the photoluminescence spectra of
self-assembled quantum dots and rings.

hard X-ray emission in excess to the known thermal component. Suzaku detected
X-ray signals in the wide energy band from 0.5 to 40 keV. The hard X-ray (> 10
keV) flux observed by the HXD around the cluster center cannot be explained by
a simple extension of the thermal emission with average temperature of ~7 keV.
The emission is most likely an emission from a very hot (kT > 13.2 keV) thermal
component around the cluster center, produced via a strong heating process in
the merger. In the north-west radio relic, no signature of non-thermal emission
was observed. Using the HXD, the overall upper-limit flux within a 34'x34'
field-of-view around the relic is derived to be 5.3e-12 erg s-1 cm-2 in the
10-40 keV band, after subtracting the ICM contribution estimated using the XIS
or the XMM-Newton spectra. Directly on the relic region, the upper limit is
further tightened by the XIS data to be less than 7.3e-13 erg s-1 cm-2, when
converted into the 10--40 keV band. The latter value suggest that the average
magnetic field within the relic is higher than 1.6 uG. The non-thermal pressure
due to magnetic fields and relativistic electrons may be as large as ~20% of
the thermal pressure in the region.

all other lines of the Lyman series, which have a stronger red-horn, Ly-a has a
dominating blue-horn asymmetry. There appears to be a brightness-to-asymmetry
relationship. A similar and even clearer trend is observed in the
downflow-to-asymmetry relationship. This important result is consistent with
predictions from models that include flows. However, the absence of a clear CLV

evolution of dust in primordial supernovae (SNe) that are considered to be the
main sources of dust in the early universe. Being combined with the results of
calculations of dust formation in the ejecta of Population III SNe, the
investigations of the evolution of newly formed dust within supernova remnants
(SNRs) show that smaller grains are predominantly destroyed by sputtering in
the shocked gas, while larger grains are injected into the ambient medium. The
mass of dust grains surviving the destruction in SNRs reaches up to 0.1--15
$M_\odot$, which is high enough to account for the content of dust observed for
the host galaxies of quasars at $z > 5$. In addition, the transport of dust
formed in the ejecta causes the formation of low-mass stars in the dense shell
of primordial SNRs and affects the elemental composition of those stars. We
also show that the flat extinction curve is expected in the high-redshift
universe where SNe are the possible sources of dust.

weak decoherence and fast quenches to approximately 1 for slow transitions or

rotation of the parent stars due to the pull of tidal forces towards spin-orbit

sufficient to realize the transport. Particularly for the system with

symmetric Si/SiGe quantum wells without the D'yakonov-Perel' spin-relaxation

is caused by the inhomogeneous broadening from the momentum-dependent spin
precessions in spatial domain under a magnetic field in the Voigt
configuration. In fact, this inhomogeneous broadening together with the
scattering lead to an irreversible spin relaxation along the spin diffusion.
The effects of scattering, magnetic field and electron density on spin
diffusion are investigated. Unlike the case of spin diffusion in the system
with the D'yakonov-Perel' spin-orbit coupling such as GaAs quantum wells where
the scattering can either enhance or reduce spin diffusion depending on whether
the system is in strong or weak scattering limit, the scattering in the present
system has no counter-effect on the inhomogeneous broadening and suppresses the
spin diffusion monotonically. The increase of magnetic field reduces the spin
diffusion, while the increase of electron density enhances the spin diffusion
when the electrons are degenerate but has marginal effect when the electrons

to attempt a measurement of the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect
through the Juno's node Omega which would be displaced by about 570 m over the
mission's duration. Conversely, by assuming the validity of general relativity,
the proposed test can be viewed as a direct, dynamical measurement of the
Jupiter's angular momentum S which would give important information concerning
the internal structure and formation of the giant planet. The long-period
orbital perturbations due to the zonal harmonic coefficients J_L, L=2,3,4,6 of
the multipolar expansion of the jovian gravitational potential accounting for
its departures from spherical symmetry are a major source of systematic bias.
While the Lense-Thirring node rate is independent of the inclination i, the

errors will induce departures \delta i from the ideal polar geometry, so that
the zonal perturbations will come into play at an unacceptably high level, in
spite of the expected improvements in the low-degree zonals by Juno. A linear
combination of Omega, the periJove omega and the mean anomaly M cancels out the
impact of J_2 and J_6. A two orders of magnitude improvement in the uncanceled

a version of the Faddeev-Skyrme model is considered in which the scalar field
is coupled dynamically to a one-form field called the supercurrent. This
coupled model is investigated in the general setting where physical space is an
oriented Riemannian manifold and the target space is a Kaehler manifold. It is
shown that supercurrent coupling destroys the topological stability enjoyed by
the usual Faddeev-Skyrme model, so that there can be no globally stable knot
solitons in this model. Nonetheless, local energy minimizers may still exist.
The first variation formula is derived and used to construct three families of
static solutions of the model, all on compact domains. In particular, a coupled
version of the unit-charge hopfion on a three-sphere of arbitrary radius is
found. The second variation formula is derived, and used to analyze the
stability of some of these solutions. A family of stable solutions is
identified, though these may exist only in spaces of even dimension. Finally,
it is shown that, in contrast to the uncoupled model, the coupled unit hopfion
on the three-sphere of radius R is unstable for all R. This gives an explicit,
exact example of supercurrent coupling destabilizing a stable solution of the
uncoupled Faddeev-Skyrme model, and casts doubt on the conjecture of Babaev,
Faddeev and Niemi that knot solitons should exist in the low-energy regime of
two-component superconductors.

scientific goals of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (formerly known as GLAST)
and Cherenkov telescopes. In this paper we investigate the existence of
realistic chances of such a discovery selecting some nearby dwarf spheroidal
galaxies (dSph) as a target. We study the detectability with the Fermi-LAT of
the gamma-ray flux from DM annihilation in Draco, Ursa Minor, Carina, and
Sextans, for which the state-of-art DM density profiles were available. We
assume the DM is made of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles such as the
Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) and compute the expected gamma-ray flux
for optimistic choices of the unknown underlying particle physics parameters.
We then compute the boost factors due to the presence of DM clumps and of a
central supermassive black hole. Finally, we compare our predictions with the
Fermi-LAT sensitivity maps. We find that the dSph galaxies shine above the
Galactic smooth halo: e.g., the Galactic halo is brighter than the Draco dSph
only for angles smaller than 2.3 degrees above the Galactic Center. We also
find that the presence of a cusp or a constant density core in the DM mass
density profile does not produce any relevant effect in the gamma-ray flux due
to the fortunate combination of the geometrical acceptance of the Fermi-LAT
detector and the distance of the galaxies and that no significant enhancement
is given by the presence of a central black hole or a population of
sub-subhalos. We conclude that, even for the most optimistic scenario of
particle physics, the gamma-ray flux from DM annihilation in the dSph galaxies
of the LG would be too low to be detected with the Fermi-LAT.

Although S82 was already one of the best investigated sky regions with respect
to L and T dwarfs, we are able to classify 13 new L dwarfs. We have also found
eight new M7.5-M9.5 dwarfs. Four new cool white dwarfs (CWDs) discovered by us
are about 1-2 mag fainter than those previously detected in SDSS data. All new

13 objects, mostly with uncertain proper motions, which we initially classified

classification (sdM7 or earlier types), whereas we have not found any new
spectra resembling the known ultracool ($>$sdM7) subdwarfs. Some M subdwarf
candidates have been classified based on spectral indices with large
uncertainties. We failed to detect new nearby ($d<50$ pc) L dwarfs, probably
because the S82 area was already well-investigated before. With our survey we
have demonstrated a higher efficiency in finding Galactic halo CWDs than
previous searches. The space density of halo CWDs is according to our results
about 1.5-3.0 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ pc$^{-3}$.

from the Casimir pressure F_C at zero slab-mirror distances to the non-retarded

Scattering Transform (IST) method. A particularly powerful aspect of the IST is
its ability to predict the large $t$ behavior of the solution. Namely, starting
with initial data $u(x,0)$, IST implies that the solution $u(x,t)$ asymptotes
to a collection of solitons as $t \to \infty$, $x/t = O(1)$; moreover the
shapes and speeds of these solitons can be computed from $u(x,0)$ using only
{\it linear} operations. One of the most important developments in this area
has been the generalization of the IST from initial to initial-boundary value
(IBV) problems formulated on the half-line. It can be shown that again $u(x,t)$
asymptotes into a collection of solitons, where now the shapes and the speeds
of these solitons depend both on $u(x,0)$ and on the given boundary conditions
at $x = 0$. A major complication of IBV problems is that the computation of the
shapes and speeds of the solitons involves the solution of a {\it nonlinear}
Volterra integral equation. However, for a certain class of boundary
conditions, called linearizable, this complication can be bypassed and the
relevant computation is as effective as in the case of the problem on the line.
Here, after reviewing the general theory for KdV, we analyze three different
types of linearizable boundary conditions. For these cases, the initial
conditions are: (a) restrictions of one and two soliton solutions at $t = 0$;
(b) profiles of certain exponential type; (c) box-shaped profiles. For each of
these cases, by computing explicitly the shapes and the speeds of the
asymptotic solitons, we elucidate the influence of the boundary.
