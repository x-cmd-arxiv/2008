  Nuclei in the Cosmos (NIC X)"", Mackinac Island, MI, USA",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The abundance patterns of metal-poor stars provide us a wealth of chemical
information about various stages of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. In
particular, these stars allow us to study the formation and evolution of the
elements and the involved nucleosynthesis processes. Metal-poor stars are the
local equivalent of the high-redshift Universe, and thus offer crucial
observational constraints on a variety of issues regarding the early Universe.
This review presents an introduction to metal-poor stars and their role as
""cosmic lab"" for the study of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis processes,
particularly that of the r-process. The metal-poor star HE 1523-0901 serves as
an example for this group of objects. It displays in its spectrum the strongest
overabundance of neutron-capture elements associated with the r-process. Heavy
neutron-capture elements such as Eu, Os, and Ir were measured, as well as the
radioactive elements Th and U. Abundance of Th and U, in conjunction with those
of stable elements make possible nucleo-chronomtery, i.e., the determination of
stellar ages. HE 1523-0901 appears to be ~13 Gyr old. Age uncertaintites range
from 2-5 Gyr for individual chronometers, and are largly due to theoretical
uncertainties in the initial production ratio of the employed chronometers. The
decay product of the radioactive elements, lead, can be used to constrain
r-process calculations. Only few such stars are currently known with detected
U. These objects, however, are crucial for the study of this nucleosynthesis
process.

Ackerman-Carroll-Wise model, characterized by a fixed-norm vector field, is
unstable. We found the instability by explicitly solving the linearized
equations for the most general set of perturbations around this background, and
by noticing that the solutions diverge close to horizon crossing. This happens
because one perturbation becomes a ghost at that moment. A simplified
computation, with only the perturbations of the vector field included, shows
the same instability, clarifying the origin of the problem. We then discuss
several other models, with a particular emphasis on the case of a nonminimal
coupling to the curvature, in which vector fields are used either to support an
anisotropic expansion, or to generate cosmological perturbations on an
isotropic background. In many cases, the mass term of the vector needs to have
the ``wrong'' sign; we show that, as a consequence, the longitudinal vector
mode is a ghost (a field with negative kinetic term, and negative energy; not
simply a tachyon). We comment on problems that arise at the quantum level. In
particular, the presence of a ghost can be a serious difficulty for the UV
completion that such models require in the sub-horizon regime.

all homogeneous components of dimension at most two, and satisfying a more
stringent but natural narrowness condition modeled on an analogous one for
pro-p groups. The two-dimensional homogeneous components of L, which include
that of degree one, are named diamonds. Infinite-dimensional thin Lie algebras
with various diamond patterns have been produced, over fields of positive
characteristic, as loop algebras of suitable finite-dimensional simple Lie
algebras, of classical or of Cartan type depending on the location of the
second diamond. The goal of this paper is a description of the initial
structure of a thin Lie algebra, up to the second diamond.
  Specifically, if L_k is the second diamond of L, then the quotient L/L^k is a
graded Lie algebras of maximal class. In characteristic not two, L/L^k is known
to be metabelian, and hence uniquely determined up to isomorphism by its
dimension k, which ranges in an explicitly known set of possible values. The
quotient L/L^k need not be metabelian in characteristic two. We describe here
all the possibilities for L/L^k up to isomorphism. In particular, we prove that
k+1 equals a power of two.

B2 0902+34 at z=3.4. We observe a halo of Lyman-alpha emission with a velocity
dispersion of 250 km/s extending to a radius of 50 kpc. A second feature is
revealed in a spatially resolved region where the line profile shows
blueshifted structure. This may be viewed as either HI absorption at -450 km/s
or secondary emission at -900 km/s from the primary peak. Our new data, in
combination with the 21 cm absorption, suggest two important and unexplained
discrepancies. First, nowhere in the line profiles of the Lyman-alpha halo is
the 21 cm absorber population evident. Second, the 21 cm absorption redshift is
higher than the Lyman-alpha emission redshift. In an effort to explain these
two traits, we have undertaken the first three dimensional Monte Carlo
simulations of resonant scattering in radio galaxies. Though simple, the model
produces the features in the Lyman-alpha data and predicts the 21 cm

of the HI is strictly necessary. The amount of gas necessary to match the model

of the D1-D5 system (with charges Q_1 and Q_5), by scattering with an
incoherent beam, composed of a supergravity probe, with central energy E_0 and
width (\Delta E). The scattering is studied in the dual CFT description in the
orbifold limit for finite R, where R is the radius of the circle on which the
D1 branes are wrapped. When R(\Delta E) >> 1, the absorption cross-section is
found to be independent of the microstate and identical to the leading
semiclassical answer computed from the naive geometry. For smaller (\Delta E),
the answer depends on the particular microstate, which we examine for both
typical and atypical microstates. We derive an upper bound for the leading
correction to the cross-section when 1/R >> \Delta E >> (the average energy gap
1/{R [sqrt(Q_1Q_5)]}. For a typical state the bound is proportional to the area
of the stretched horizon, [\sqrt(Q_1 Q_5)], up to [log (Q_1Q_5)] terms.
Furthermore, when E_0 << (\Delta E), the proportionality constant is a pure
number independent of all energy scales. Numerical calculations using
Lorentzian profiles show that the actual value of the correction is in fact
proportional to [sqrt(Q_1Q_5)] without the logarithmic factor. We offer some
speculations about how this result can be consistent with a resolution of the
naive geometry by higher derivative corrections to supergravity.

  - A morphism between inverse sequences of countable (possibly non-abelian)
groups that induces isomorphisms on inverse and derived limits is invertible in
the pro-category. This implies the ""Whitehead theorem in Steenrod homotopy"",
thereby answering two questions of A.Koyama.
  - If X is an LC_{n-1} compactum, n>0, its n-dimensional Steenrod homotopy
classes are representable by maps S^n\to X, provided that X is simply
connected. The assumption of simply-connectedness cannot be dropped by a
well-known example of Dydak and Zdravkovska.

  Flux Coherent States",,,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The volume operator plays a pivotal role for the quantum dynamics of Loop
Quantum Gravity (LQG), both in the full theory and in truncated models adapted
to cosmological situations coined Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). It is therefore
crucial to check whether its semiclassical limit coincides with the classical
volume operator plus quantum corrections. In the present article we investigate
this question by generalizing and employing previously defined coherent states
for LQG which derive from a cylindrically consistently defined complexifier
operator which is the quantization of a known classical function. These
coherent states are not normalizable due to the non separability of the LQG
Hilbert space but they define uniquely define cut off states depending on a
finite graph. The result of our analysis is that the expectation value of the
volume operator with respect to coherent states depending on a graph with only
n valent verticies reproduces its classical value at the phase space point at
which the coherent state is peaked only if n = 6. In other words, the
semiclassical sector of LQG defined by those states is described by graphs with
cubic topology! This has some bearing on current spin foam models which are all
based on four valent boundary spin networks.

attract enormous interest, in particular as a new kind of matter, in which
electron transport is governed by a Dirac-like wave equation, and as a model
system for studying electronic and phonon properties of other, more complex,
graphitic materials[1-4]. Here, we uncover the constitutive relation of
graphene and probe new physics of its optical phonons, by studying its Raman
spectrum as a function of uniaxial strain. We find that the doubly degenerate
E2g optical mode splits in two components, one polarized along the strain and
the other perpendicular to it. This leads to the splitting of the G peak into
two bands, which we call G+ and G-, by analogy with the effect of curvature on
the nanotube G peak[5-7]. Both peaks red shift with increasing strain, and
their splitting increases, in excellent agreement with first-principles
calculations. Their relative intensities are found to depend on light
polarization, which provides a useful tool to probe the graphene
crystallographic orientation with respect to the strain. The singly degenerate
2D and 2D' bands also red shift, but do not split for small strains. We study
the Gruneisen parameters for the phonons responsible for the G, D and D' peaks.
These can be used to measure the amount of uniaxial or biaxial strain,

comprehensively compares auto-associative neural networks (NN), neuro-fuzzy

also under principal component analysis (PCA) conditions. The neural network
outperforms the neuro-fuzzy system for all tests by an average of 5.8%, while
the hybrid method is on average 15.9% more accurate yet 50% less

impact assessment of the imputed data is performed by several statistical
tests. It is found that although the imputed accuracy is high, the global

investigated by using asymptotic expansions in the small disk aspect ratio
\epsilon. The model incorporates the azimuthal and poloidal components of the
magnetic fields in the leading order in \epsilon. The disk structure is
described by an appropriate Grad-Shafranov equation for the poloidal flux
function \psi that involves two arbitrary functions of \psi for the toroidal
and poloidal currents. The flux function is symmetric about the midplane and
satisfies certain boundary conditions at the near-horizontal disk edges. The
boundary conditions model the combined effect of the primordial as well as the
dipole-like magnetic fields. An analytical solution for the Hall equilibrium is
achieved by further expanding the relevant equations in an additional small
parameter \delta that is inversely proportional to the Hall parameter. It is
thus found that the Hall equilibrium disks fall into two types: Keplerian disks
with (i) small (Rd ~\delta^0) and (ii) large (Rd > \delta^k, k > 0) radius of
the disk. The numerical examples that are presented demonstrate the richness

analyzed in the low-power and wideband regimes by employing the effective
capacity formulation, rather than the Shannon capacity. Through this analysis,
energy requirements under QoS constraints are identified. The analysis is
conducted under two assumptions: perfect channel side information (CSI)
available only at the receiver and perfect CSI available at both the receiver
and transmitter. In particular, it is shown in the low-power regime that the
minimum bit energy required under QoS constraints is the same as that attained
when there are no such limitations. However, this performance is achieved as
the transmitted power vanishes. Through the wideband slope analysis, the
increased energy requirements at low but nonzero power levels in the presence
of QoS constraints are determined. A similar analysis is also conducted in the
wideband regime, and minimum bit energy and wideband slope expressions are
obtained. In this regime, the required bit energy levels are found to be
strictly greater than those achieved when Shannon capacity is considered.

discs but also via the acceleration of jets. We investigate the relative
importance of these two paths over cosmic time by determining the mechanical
luminosity function (LF) of radio sources and by comparing it to a previous
determination of the bolometric LF of active galactic nuclei (AGN) from X-ray,
optical and infrared observations. The mechanical LF of radio sources is
computed in two steps: the determination of the mechanical luminosity as a
function of the radio luminosity and its convolution with the radio LF of radio
sources. Even with the large uncertainty deriving from the former, we can
conclude that the contribution of jets is unlikely to be much larger than 10%
of the AGN energy budget at any cosmic epoch.

different scaling relationships between massive black holes and their hosts
(bulge mass, velocity dispersion, and their possible redshift dependences), and
discuss their consistency. We then compute dynamical friction timescales for
the double quasar systems to investigate their frequency and their agreement
with scenarios for quasar triggering. Comparing typical merging timescales to
expected quasar lifetimes, the fraction of double quasars should be roughly a
factor of 10 larger than observed. Additionally, we find that, depending on the
correlations between black holes and their hosts, the occurrence of double
quasars could be redshift-dependent. Comparison of our models to the SDSS
quasar catalog suggests that double quasars should be more common at high
redshift. We compare the typical separations at which double quasars are
observed to the predictions of merger simulations. We find that the
distribution of physical separations peaks at ~30 kpc, with a tail at larger
separations (~100-200 kpc). These large separation pairs are instead consistent
with unequal mass mergers where gas is dynamically perturbed during the first
pericentric passage, but the gas reaches the black hole only at the next
apocenter, where the pair is observed.

antiferromagnetic fluctuations, and the presence of a mysterious pseudogap
phase close to the Mott state, one can conclude that high-Tc superconductors
are clearly distinguishable from the well-understood BCS superconductors. The
d-wave superconducting state can be understood through a Gutzwiller-type
projected BCS wave-function. In this review article, we revisit the Hubbard
model at half-filling and focus on the emergence of exotic superconductivity
with d-wave symmetry in the vicinity of the Mott state, starting from ladder
systems and then studying the dimensional crossovers to higher dimensions. This
allows to confirm that short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations can mediate
superconductivity with d-wave symmetry. Ladders are also nice prototype systems
allowing to demonstrate the truncation of the Fermi surface and the emergence
of a Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) state with preformed pairs in the vicinity
of the Mott state. In two dimensions, a similar scenario emerges from
renormalization group arguments. We also discuss theoretical predictions for
the d-wave superconducting phase as well as the pseudogap phase, and address
the crossover to the overdoped regime. Finally, cold atomic systems with
tunable parameters also provide a complementary insight into this outstanding
problem.

reconstruction methods which are reliable under limited information is a
crucial endeavor. There have been two approaches to this problem:
reconstructing partial but reliable information about the tree (\cite{Mo07,
DMR08,DHJ06,GMS08}), and reaching ""deeper"" in the tree through reconstruction
of ancestral sequences. In the latter category, \cite{DMR06} settled an
important conjecture of M.Steel, showing that, under the CFN model of
evolution, all trees on $n$ leaves with edge lengths bounded by the Ising model
phase transition can be recovered with high probability from genomes of length
$O(\log n)$ with a polynomial time algorithm. Their methods had a running time
of $O(n^{10})$.
  Here we enhance our methods from \cite{DHJ06} with the learning of ancestral

multi-wavelength observations obtained with several ground-based and

after SN 2004dj faded away. Sandage-96 started to dominate the flux in the
optical bands starting September 2006 (~800 d after explosion). The optical
fluxes are equal to the pre-explosion ones within the observational
uncertainties. An optical Keck spectrum obtained ~900 d after explosion shows
the dominant blue continuum from the cluster stars shortward of 6000 \AA as
well as strong SN nebular emission lines redward. The integrated spectral
energy distribution (SED) of the cluster has been extended into the ultraviolet
region by archival XMM-Newton and new Swift observations, and compared with
theoretical models. The outer parts of the cluster have been resolved by the
Hubble Space Telescope, allowing the construction of a color-magnitude diagram.
The fitting of the cluster SED with theoretical isochrones results in cluster
ages between 10--40 Myr, depending on metallicity and the model family. The
isochrone fitting indicates that the resolved part of the cluster has a bimodal
age distribution: a younger population at ~10--16 Myr, and an older one at
~32--100 Myr which is similar to the age distribution of the nearby field
stars. These stars may have been captured from the field during the cluster
formation. The young age of Sandage-96 suggest 12 < M_prog < 20 M_\odot as the
most probable mass range for the progenitor of SN 2004dj. This is consistent
with, but perhaps slightly higher than, most of the other Type II-plateau SN

We find that the most prominent difference shows up in the morphology of the
edge features with negative excess that appear at the edge of the circle with
its center located at the caustic center and a radius equivalent to the source
radius. It is found that the feature induced a binary companion forms a
complete annulus, while the feature induced by a planet appears as several arc
segments. This difference provides a useful diagnostic for immediate
iscrimination of a planet-induced perturbation from that induced by a binary
companion, where the absence of a well-developed dip in the residual from the
single-lensing light curve at both or either of the moments of the caustic
center's entrance into and exit from the source star surface indicates that the
perturbation is produced by a planetary companion. We find that that this
difference is basically caused by the difference between the shapes of the
central caustics induced by the two different types of companions.

The study of this system is particularly interesting for understanding the
connection between mergers and bars as well as the properties and fate of this

morphological and kinematic properties of J033239.72-275154.7, the latter
obtained by the GIRAFFE spectrograph, to those derived from the merger of two
spiral galaxies described by idealized N-body simulations including a star
formation prescription. (Results) We found that the general morphological shape
and most of the dynamical properties of the object can be well reproduced by a
model in which the satellite is initially put in a retrograde orbit and the
mass ratio of the system is 1:3. In such a scenario, a bar forms in the host
galaxy after the first passage of the satellite where an important fraction of
available gas is consumed in an induced burst. In its later evolution, however,
we find that J033239.72-275154.7, whose major progenitor was an Sab galaxy,
will probably become a S0 galaxy. This is mainly due to the violent relaxation
and the angular momentum loss experienced by the host galaxy during the merger
process, which is caused by the adopted orbital parameters. This result
suggests that the building of the Hubble sequence is significantly influenced
by the last major collision. In the present case, the merger leads to a severe
damage of the disk of the progenitor, leading to an evolution towards a more
bulge dominated galaxy.

conjectures concerning quantized coordinate rings and their semiclassical
limits, with a particular focus on primitive ideal spaces. The semiclassical
limit of a family of quantized coordinate rings of an affine algebraic variety
V consists of the classical coordinate ring O(V) equipped with an associated
Poisson structure. Conjectured relationships between primitive ideals of a
generic quantized coordinate ring A and symplectic leaves in V (relative to a
semiclassical limit Poisson structure on O(V)) are discussed, as are breakdowns
in the connections when the symplectic leaves are not algebraic. This prompts
replacement of the differential-geometric concept of symplectic leaves with the
algebraic concept of symplectic cores, and a reformulated conjecture is
proposed: The primitive spectrum of A should be homeomorphic to the space of
symplectic cores in V, and to the Poisson-primitive spectrum of O(V). Various
examples, including both quantized coordinate rings and enveloping algebras of
solvable Lie algebras, are analyzed to support the choice of symplectic cores
to replace symplectic leaves.

shocks - also called standing shocks - which connect two different periodic
stationary solutions to one another. We prove that standing shocks are stable
in $L^1$, provided the initial disturbance satisfies some appropriate

simulations of this process. We evolve the hydrodynamics equations with
optically thin cooling for a 3D Kelvin Helmholtz setup with one initial cold
cloud. The cloud is quickly disrupted, but the fragments remain cold and are
spread throughout our simulation box. A scale free isotropic Kolmogorov power
spectrum is built up first on the large scales, and reaches almost down to the
grid scale after the simulation time of ten million years. We find a pronounced
peak in the temperature distribution at 14,000K. The luminosity of the gas in
this peak is correlated with the energy. We interpret this as a realisation of
the shock ionisation scenario. The interplay between shock heating and
radiative cooling establishes the equilibrium temperature. This is close to the
observed emission in some Narrow Line Regions. We also confirm the shift of the
phase equilibrium, i.e. a lower (higher) level of turbulence produces a higher
(lower) abundance of cold gas. The effect could plausibly lead to a high level
of cold gas condensation in the cocoons of extragalactic jets, explaining the

than 0.22%, and an area larger than or equal to 3 pixels, and compare their
occurrence rates and distribution of magnetic field azimuth. We obtain
probability density functions (PDFs) of magnetic field strength and inclination
for both regions.The occurrence rate in the plage region is the same as for the
quiet Sun. The vertical magnetic flux in the plage region is ~8 times larger
than in the quiet Sun. There is essentially no preferred orientation for the
THMFs in either region. However, THMFs in the plage region with higher LP have
a preferred direction consistent with that of the plage-region's large-scale
vertical field pattern. PDFs show that there is no difference in the
distribution of field strength of horizontal fields between the quiet Sun and
the plage regions when we avoid the persistent large vertical flux
concentrations for the plage region. The similarity of the PDFs and of the
occurrence rates in plage and quiet regions suggests that a local dynamo
process due to the granular motion may generate THMFs all over the sun. The

Telescopes (IACT), is used to observe the targets in the range of VHE gamma
rays. Results: No significant gamma-ray signal is found at the respective
position of the two clusters with several different source size assumptions for
each target. In particular, emission regions corresponding to the high density
core, to the extension of the entire X-ray emission in these clusters, and to
the very extended region where the accretion shock is expected, are
investigated. Upper limits are derived for the gamma-ray flux at energies E>570
GeV for Abell 496 and E>460 GeV for Abell 85. Conclusions: From the
non-detection in VHE gamma rays, upper limits on the total energy of hadronic
CRs in the clusters are calculated. If the cosmic-ray energy density follows
the large scale gas density profile, the limit on the fraction of energy in
these non-thermal particles with respect to the total thermal energy of the
intra-cluster medium (ICM) is 51% for Abell 496 and only 8% for Abell 85 due to
its larger mass and higher gas density. These upper limits are compared with
theoretical estimates. They predict about ~10% of the thermal energy of the ICM
in non-thermal particles. The observations presented here can constrain these
predictions especially for the case of the Abell 85 cluster.

We show here that their soft X-ray spectrum exhibits a soft excess with the
same characteristics as that observed ubiquitously in radio-quiet Seyfert 1
galaxies and type 1 quasars, both in terms of temperatures and strength.
However, even when the soft X-ray excess is modelled with a pure thermal disc,
its luminosity turns out to be much lower than that expected from accretion
theory for the given temperature, casting further doubts on a thermal
interpretation for soft excesses. While alternative scenarios for the nature of
the soft excess (namely smeared ionized absorption and disc reflection) cannot
be distinguished on a pure statistical basis, we point out that the absorption
model produces a strong correlation between absorbing column density and
ionization state, which may be difficult to interpret and is most likely
spurious. As for reflection, it does only invoke standard ingredients of any
accretion model for radiatively efficient sources such as a hard X-rays source
and a relatively cold (though partially ionized) accretion disc, and therefore
seems the natural choice to explain the soft excess in most (if not all) cases.
The reflection model is also consistent with the additional presence of a
thermal disc component with the theoretically expected temperature (although,
again, with smaller-than-expected total luminosity). The observed active
galaxies are among the most variable in X-rays and their excess variance is
among the largest. This is in line with their relatively small black hole mass
and with expectations from simple power spectra models. (abridged)

Considerable attention has been and remains focused on this subject not only
because industry is very concerned but also because of mathematical
difficulties that make the numerical resolution of the problem very difficult.
It was recently observed in a numerical study on a high order perturbation
method under heavy fluid loading that a loaded vibrating plate results in a
frequency shift of the in vacuo single resonance (in both the real part because
of the fluid added mass and the imaginary part because of energy lost by
radiation into the fluid) as well as increase in the number of the resonance
frequencies : as a result of the loading, each single in vacuo resonance
frequency of the structure is transformed into a multiple resonance frequency.
Here we show that this phenomenon is said to be an extension to the heavy
loading condition of the Sanchez's classical result that have established that
in the case of a light loading conditions ""the scattering frequencies of a
fluid loaded elastic structure (ie the resonance frequencies) are nearly the
real eigenfrequencies of the elastic body alone and the complex scattering
frequencies of the fluid with a rigid solid"". Using classical results in the
framework of the theory of entire functions, it is established that a single

amplifications and deletions. Within any given tumor type, sample specific
amplifications and deletionsare also observed. Typically, a region that is
aberrant in more tumors,or whose copy number change is stronger, would be
considered as a more promising candidate to be biologically relevant to cancer.
We sought for an intuitive method to define such aberrations and prioritize
them. We define V, the volume associated with an aberration, as the product of
three factors: a. fraction of patients with the aberration, b. the aberrations
length and c. its amplitude. Our algorithm compares the values of V derived
from real data to a null distribution obtained by permutations, and yields the
statistical significance, p value, of the measured value of V. We detected
genetic locations that were significantly aberrant and combined them with
chromosomal arm status to create a succint fingerprint of the tumor genome.
This genomic fingerprint is used to visualize the tumors, highlighting events
that are co ocurring or mutually exclusive. We allpy the method on three
different public array CGH datasets of Medulloblastoma and Neuroblastoma, and
demonstrate its ability to detect chromosomal regions that were known to be
altered in the tested cancer types, as well as to suggest new genomic locations

Inside the random tube, which is stationary and ergodic, non-interacting

are reflected randomly, according to the cosine law: the density of the
outgoing direction is proportional to the cosine of the angle between this
direction and the normal vector. Steady state transport is studied by
introducing an open tube segment as follows: We cut out a large finite segment
of the tube with segment boundaries perpendicular to the tube axis. Particles
which leave this piece through the segment boundaries disappear from the
system. Through stationary injection of particles at one boundary of the
segment a steady state with non-vanishing stationary particle current is
maintained. We prove (i) that in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite open
piece the coarse-grained density profile inside the segment is linear, and (ii)
that the transport diffusion coefficient obtained from the ratio of stationary
current and effective boundary density gradient equals the diffusion
coefficient of a tagged particle in an infinite tube. Thus we prove Fick's law

both cases the problem can be solved by employing the unified approach to
boundary value problems introduced by on of the authors in the late 1990s. The
problem on the full line was analysed by Crighton et. al. using a combination
of Laplace and Fourier transforms. The new approach avoids the technical
difficulty of the a priori assumption that the amplitude of the plate is in
$L^1_{dt}(R^+)$ and furthermore yields a simpler solution representation which
immediately implies the problem is well-posed. For the problem on the
half-line, a similar analysis yields a solution representation, but this
formula involves two unknown functions. The main difficulty with the half-line
problem is the characterisation of these two functions. By employing the
so-called global relation, we show that the two functions can be obtained via
the solution of a complex valued integral equation of the convolution type.
This equation can be solved in closed form using the Laplace transform. By
prescribing the initial data $\eta_0$ to be in $H^3(R^+)$, we show that the
solution depends continuously on the initial data, and hence, the problem is
well-posed.

wind show that the individual ion contributions, $L_p$ and $L_\alpha$, tend to
be negative (i.e., in the sense of counter-rotation with the Sun). However, the
opposite holds for the slow wind, and the overall particle contribution $L_P =
L_p + L_\alpha$ tends to exceed the magnetic one $L_M$. These aspects are at
variance with previous models. We examine whether introducing realistic ion
temperature anisotropies can resolve this discrepancy. From the general
multifluid transport equations with gyrotropic species pressure tensors, we
derive the equations governing both the meridional and azimuthal dynamics of
general axisymmetrical, rotating stellar winds that include two major ion
species. The azimuthal dynamics are examined in detail, using the empirically
constructed meridional flow profiles for the solar wind. We find that $L$ is
determined by requiring that the solution to the total angular momentum
conservation law is unique and smooth close to the Alfven point, where the
combined Alfvenic Mach number $M_T=1$. Introducing realistic ion temperature
anisotropies may introduce a change of up to 10% in $L$ and up to 1.8 km/s in
azimuthal speeds of individual ions between 0.3 and 1 AU, compared with the
isotropic case. The latter has strong consequences on the relative importance
of $L_P$ and $L_M$. However, introducing ion temperature anisotropies cannot
resolve the discrepancy between measurements and models. For the fast-wind
solutions, while in extreme cases $L_P$ becomes negative, $L_p$ never does. On
the other hand, for the slow-wind solutions, $L_P$ never exceeds $L_M$, even
though $L_M$ may be less than the individual ion contribution, since $L_p$ and
$L_\alpha$ always have opposite signs for the slow and fast wind alike.

dimensions for warped braneworld models with a spatially flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) line element on the 3-brane and with a

looking at the status of energy conditions when such a bulk line element is
assumed. We check these conditions by analysing the relevant inequalities, for
specific functional forms (chosen to satisfy certain desirable features) of the
warp factor, the cosmological scale factor and the extra-dimensional scale
factor. Subsequently, we aim at obtaining solutions with different types of
bulk matter sources. We begin with a general analysis of the solution space of
non-singular Randall-Sundrum type bulk models with an exponential warp factor
and a chosen equation of state. Thereafter, we focus on three specific bulk
sources -- the ordinary scalar field, the Brans-Dicke scalar and the dilaton.
In each case, we are able to solve the field equations and obtain desirable
solutions for which, we once again check the viability of the energy
conditions. We also show how one can place branes in the bulk using the
junction conditions. The issue of resolution of the bulk singularities which
appear in our solutions, using standard methods, is also presented briefly. In
summary, we are able to demonstrate, that it is indeed possible to construct
viable bulk spacetimes for warped cosmological braneworlds with a time-varying

are the harmonic fitting method and the iterative non-linear filter that,
coupled respectively with the Box Least-Square (BLS) and Box Maximum-Likelihood
algorithms, demonstrated the best performance during the first detection blind
test organized inside the CoRoT consortium. The third method, the 3-spot model,
is a simplified physical model of Sun-like variability and the fourth is a
simple sliding boxcar filter. We apply a Monte Carlo approach by simulating a
large number of 150-day light curves (as for CoRoT long runs) for different
planetary radii, orbital periods, epochs of the first transit and standard
deviations of the photon shot noise. Stellar variability is given by the Total
Solar Irradiance variations as observed close to the maximum of solar cycle 23.
After filtering solar variability, transits are searched for by means of the
BLS algorithm. We find that the iterative non-linear filter is the best method
to filter light curves of solar-like stars when a suitable window can be
chosen. As the performance of this filter depends critically on the length of
its window, we point out that the window must be as long as possible, according
to the magnetic activity level of the star. We show an automatic method to
choose the extension of the filter window from the power spectrum of the light
curves. The iterative non-linear filter, when used with a suitable choice of
its window, has a better performance than more complicated and computationally
intensive methods of fitting solar-like variability, like the 200-harmonic
fitting or the 3-spot model.

accurate approximations ranging from the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) to
the vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) method and the exact solution are
described. A thorough analysis of the approximations is presented for model
monoatomic and hydrogen-bonded chains, and results are presented for a linear
HF chain where the potential energy surface is obtained via first-principles
electronic structure calculations. We focus on quantum nuclear effects on the
lattice constant, and show that the VSCF is an excellent approximation, meaning
that correlation between modes is not extremely important. The QHA is excellent
for covalently-bonded, mildly anharmonic systems, but it fails for
hydrogen-bonded ones. In the latter, the zero-point energy exhibits a
non-analytic behavior at the lattice constant where the H-atoms center, which
leads to a spurious secondary minimum in the quantum-corrected energy curve. An
inexpensive anharmonic appoximation of non-interacting modes appears to produce
rather good results for hydrogen-bonded chains, for small system sizes.
However, it converges to the incorrect QHA results for increasing size. Isotope
effects are studied for the first-principles HF chain. We show how the lattice
constant and the HF distance increase with decreasing mass, and how the QHA
proves to be insufficient to reproduce this behavior.

integration procedure for Lie algebra cocycles.
  This paper remedies the obstructions for integrating cocycles and central
extensions from Lie algebras to Lie groups by generalising the integrating
objects. Those objects obey the maximal coherence that one can expect.
Moreover, we show that they are the universal ones for the integration problem.
  The main application of this result is that a Mackey-complete locally
exponential Lie algebra (e.g., a Banach-Lie algebra) integrates to a Lie
2-group in the sense that there is a natural Lie functor from certain Lie
2-groups to Lie algebras, sending the integrating Lie 2-group to an isomorphic

also conserved in time. We also find a relative conserved quantity for such a

provides at least two insights in the theory of conserved quantities in General

conserved quantities is carefully studied and proved to be vanishing. Second,
we explicitly show that our superpotential (that happens to coincide with the
so-called KBL potential although it is generated differently) provides strong
conservation laws under much weaker hypotheses than the ones usually required.
In particular, the symmetry generator is not needed to be Killing (nor Killing

an approach based on the study of energy landscapes: The relation between
stationary points of the potential energy landscape of a classical
many-particle system and the analyticity properties of its thermodynamic
functions is studied for finite as well as infinite systems. For finite
systems, each stationary point is found to cause a nonanalyticity in the
microcanonical entropy, and the functional form of this nonanalytic term can be
derived explicitly. With increasing system size, the order of the nonanalytic
term grows unboundedly, leading to an increasing differentiability of the
entropy. Therefore, in the thermodynamic limit, only asymptotically flat
stationary points may cause a phase transition to take place. For several spin
models, these results are illustrated by predicting the absence or presence of
a phase transition from stationary points and their local curvatures in
microscopic configuration space. These results establish a relationship between
properties of energy landscapes and the occurrence of phase transitions. Such
an approach appears particularly promising for the simultaneous study of
dynamical and thermodynamical properties, as is of interest for example for
protein folding or the glass transition.

within 1.5 arcmin (750 kpc) brighter than K~20.7 mag. The high redshift of
JKCS041 is determined from the detection colour, from the detection of the
cluster in a galaxy sample formed by z_phot>1.6 galaxies and from a photometric
redshift based on 11-band spectral energy distribution fitting. By means of the
latter we find the cluster redshift to be 1.84<z<2.12 at 68 % confidence.
Therefore, JKCS041 is a cluster of galaxies at z=1.9 with deep potential well,
making it the most distant cluster with extended X-ray emission known.

out as an important control parameter to study the phase diagram and the nature

clumps associated with 8.6 GHz radio emission, indicating the presence of an

particular, thermal CH3OH is found to be brighter and more abundant in
Ultra-Compact HII (UCHII) regions and in sources with detected CH3CN, and may
constitute a crude molecular clock in single dish observations. Clumps
associated with 8.6 GHz radio emission tend to be more massive and more
luminous than clumps without radio emission. This is likely because the most
massive clumps evolve so rapidly that a Hyper-Compact HII or UCHII region is
the first visible tracer of star-formation. The gas-mass to sub-mm/IR

to explain this phenomenon: turbulent mixing and photodesorption. Methods. We
compute the chemical evolution of circumstellar disks including grain surface
reactions with and without turbulent mixing and CO photodesorption. Results. We
show that photodesorption significantly enhances the gas phase CO abundance, by
extracting CO from the grains when the visual extinction remains below about 5
magnitudes. However the resulting dependence of column density on radial
distance is not consistent with observations so far. We propose that this
inconsistency could be the result of grain growth. On the other hand, the
influence of turbulent mixing is not found to be straightforward. The
efficiency of turbulent mixing depends upon a variety of parameters, including
the disk structure. For the set of parameters we chose, turbulent mixing is not
found to have any significant influence on the CO column density.

measure the CO line ratios, molecular gas masses, and instantaneous gas

4569), we obtain molecular gas masses of 7E8-3E9 Msun and disk-averaged
instantaneous gas depletion times of 1.1-1.7 Gyr. We argue that the CO J=3-2
line is a better tracer of the dense star forming molecular gas than the CO
J=1-0 line, as it shows a better correlation with the star formation rate
surface density both within and between galaxies. NGC 4254 appears to have a
larger star formation efficiency(smaller gas depletion time), perhaps because
it is on its first passage through the Virgo Cluster. NGC 4569 shows a
large-scale gradient in the gas properties traced by the CO J=3-2/J=1-0 line
ratio, which suggests that its interaction with the intracluster medium is
affecting the dense star-forming portion of the interstellar medium directly.
The fourth galaxy in our sample, NGC 4579, has weak CO J=3-2 emission despite
having bright 24 micron emission; however, much of the central luminosity in
