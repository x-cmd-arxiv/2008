finite dimension is sufficient to generate all these sets. We approach the
problem in two different ways by constructing explicit examples for every
dimension d, which demonstrates that there exist bipartite correlations that
necessitate d-dimensional local quantum systems in order to generate them. We
also show that at least 10 two-outcome measurements must be carried out by the
two parties altogether so as to generate bipartite joint correlations not
achievable by two-dimensional local systems. The smallest explicit example we
found involves 11 settings.

10%) of the mass of the entire envelope in HBe stars. For the disks, there are
large source-to-source variations. Two disks in our sample, R Mon and Z CMa,
have similar sizes and masses to those found in T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars.
The disks around MWC 1080 and MWC 297 are, however, smaller (rout<100 AU). We
did not detect the disks towards MWC 137 and LkHa 215 at millimeter
wavelengths, which limits the mass and the size of the possible circumstellar

Herbig Ae stars indicates that although massive disks (0.1 Msun) are found in
young objects (10^4 yr), the masses of the disks around Herbig Be stars are
usually 5-10 times lower than those around lower mass stars. We propose that
disk photoevaporation is responsible for this behavior. In Herbig Be stars, the
UV radiation disperses the gas in the outer disk on a timescale of a few 10^5
yr. Once the outer part of the disk has vanished, the entire gaseous disk is
photoevaporated on a very short timescale (10^5 yr) and only a small, dusty
disk consisting of large grains remains.

noncommutative Standard Model in the enveloping-algebra approach, having a
one-loop renormalisable gauge sector involving a higher order gauge term,
motivates us to consider the possibility of extending the fermion sector with
additional deformations, i.e. higher order fermionic terms. Since the
renormalisability properties of the fermion sector of the model are not yet
fully known, we work with an effective fermion lagrangian which includes
noncommutative higher order terms involving a contraction with the
noncommutative $\theta$ tensor aside from the star products, so that these
terms annihilate in the commutative limit. Some of these terms violate CPT in
the weak sector, and some violate CP in the strong and hypercharge sectors. We
apply this framework to the reevaluation of the decay rates of quarkonia
(\bar{q}q_{1} = J/\psi, \Upsilon) into two photons. These decays, which are
forbidden in the ordinary Standard Model, had been previously studied as
possible signals for noncommutativity, but not in the framework of the better
behaved deformed non-minimal version of the noncommutative Standard Model. Weak
CPT or strong-hypercharge CP violating interactions do not contribute to the
result. If the parameters of the model take natural values, for the vast
majority of configurations the resulting branching ratios are enhanced with
respect to their values in the minimal version of the noncommutative Standard
Model. Also for more than half of the parameter space, the rates are larger
than the maximal rates that were calculated in the undeformed version of the
non-minimal noncommutative Standard Model. Tuning the dimensionless parameters

equations for axisymmetric mass distributions derived from K-band images. These
simple models have only one free parameter: the dynamical mass-to-light ratio,
which we assume is independent of radius. Given the simplicity of the modelling
procedure, the model second velocity moments are strikingly good fits to the
observed stellar kinematics within the extent of our kinematic data, which
typically reach ~ 0.5-1 R25 (where R25 is the optical radius), or equivalently
2-3 Re (where Re is the effective or half-light radius). We therefore find no
evidence for a dominant dark matter component within the optical disk of spiral
galaxies. This is equally true of the S0s in our sample, which significantly
extends previous observational constraints on dark matter in these galaxies.
The predicted kinematics do deviate slightly but systematically from the
observations in the bulge region of most galaxies, but we argue that this is
consistent with the claim that boxy and peanut-shaped bulges are bars viewed

competition between gas cooling and heating. The heating comes from two
distinct sources: gravitational heating from the collapse of the dark matter
halo and thermal input from galaxy/black hole formation. However, a long
standing problem has been that cosmological simulations based on smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and Eulerian mesh codes predict different results
even when cooling and galaxy/black hole heating are switched off. Clusters
formed in SPH simulations show near powerlaw entropy profiles, while those
formed in mesh simulations develop a core and do not allow gas to reach such
low entropies. Since the cooling rate is closely connected to the minimum
entropy of the gas, the differences are of potentially key importance.
  In this paper, we investigate the origin of this discrepancy. By comparing
simulations run using the GADGET-2 SPH code and the FLASH adaptive Eulerian
mesh code, we show that the discrepancy arises during the idealised merger of
two clusters. The difference is not sensitive to the resolution of our
simulations, nor is it is due differences in the gravity solvers, Galilean
non-invariance of the mesh code, or an effect of unsuitable artificial
viscosity in the SPH code. Instead, we find that the difference is inherent to
the treatment of eddies and fluid instabilities. These are suppressed in the
SPH simulations, while the cluster mergers generate strong vortices in the mesh
simulations that efficiently mix the fluid and erase the low entropy gas.
Consequently, particles in the SPH simulations retain a close connection to
their initial entropy, while this connection is much weaker in the mesh
simulations. We discuss the potentially profound implications of these results.

cloud and we find that the numerical analysis is consistent with the results
predicted by the diagrams. While the inclusion of a homogeneous magnetic field
approximately perpendicular to the impact velocity of the SNR with an intensity
~1 $ mu$G results only a small shrinking of the star formation triggering zone
in the diagrams, a larger magnetic field (~10 $ mu$G) causes a significant
shrinking, as expected. Applications of the diagrams to a few regions of our
own galaxy have revealed that star formation in those sites could have been
triggered by shock waves from SNRs. Finally, we have evaluated the effective
star formation efficiency for this sort of interaction and found that it is
smaller than the observed values in our own Galaxy (sfe ~0.01-0.3). This result
is consistent with previous work in the literature and also suggests that the
mechanism presently investigated, though very powerful to drive structure
formation, supersonic turbulence and eventually, local star formation, does not
seem to be sufficient to drive global star formation in normal star forming
galaxies, not even when the magnetic field in the neutral clouds is neglected.

to study non-Gaussianity in cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps. Likelihood
and Bayesian estimation are applied to a local non-linear perturbed model up to
third order, characterized by a linear term which is described by a Gaussian
N-pdf, and a second and third order terms which are proportional to the square
and the cube of the linear one. We also explore a set of model selection
techniques (the Akaike and the Bayesian Information Criteria, the minimum
description length, the Bayesian Evidence and the Generalized Likelihood Ratio
Test) and their application to decide whether a given data set is better
described by the proposed local non-Gaussian model, rather than by the standard
Gaussian temperature distribution. As an application, we consider the analysis
of the WMAP 5-year data at a resolution of around 2 degrees. At this angular
scale (the Sachs-Wolfe regime), the non-Gaussian description proposed in this
work defaults (under certain conditions) to an approximative local form of the
weak non-linear coupling inflationary model (e.g. Komatsu & Spergel 2001)
previously addressed in the literature. For this particular case, we obtain an
estimation for the non-linear coupling parameter of -94 < F_nl < 154 at 95% CL.
Equally, model selection criteria also indicate that the Gaussian hypothesis is
favored against the particular local non-Gaussian model proposed in this work.
This result is in agreement with previous findings obtained for equivalent
non-Gaussian models and with different non-Gaussian estimators. However, our
estimator based on the N-pdf is more efficient than previous estimators and,
therefore, provides tighter constraints on the coupling parameter at degree
angular resolution.

multi-resolution methods correspond to linearisations of the stability at short
times. The connection between community detection and Laplacian dynamics
enables us to establish dynamically motivated stability measures linked to
distinct null models. We apply our method to find multi-scale partitions for
different networks and show that the stability can be computed efficiently for

the quantum size effects are significant for slabs with sizes smaller or near
to the Fermi wavelength of the valence electrons $\lambda_{\rm F}$, and
secondly, some slabs expand while others contract with respect to the bulk

Being unaware of the channel conditions, transmitter is assumed to send the

fixed rate in the ON state while no reliable transmission occurs in the OFF

probabilities, and effective capacity formulation is used to identify the
maximum throughput that a wireless channel can sustain while satisfying
statistical QoS constraints. Energy efficiency is investigated by obtaining the
bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency and the wideband slope in both

Comparisons with variable-rate/fixed-power and variable-rate/variable-power
cases are given. Energy efficiency is further analyzed in the presence of
channel uncertainties. The optimal fraction of power allocated to training is
identified under QoS constraints. It is proven that the minimum bit energy in
the low-power regime is attained at a certain nonzero power level below which

imprints. We review in detail a standard, linearised cosmology before
introducing an electromagnetic field. We then consider the intrinsic statistics
of the magnetic stresses in two ways, analytically and via static realisations.
We construct the power spectra, some of which we present for the first time. At
the one- and three-point level we find significant intrinsic non-Gaussianities.
Finally we turn to the observable impacts a primordial magnetic field. Assuming
coherence, the statistics of the source can be mapped onto the CMB in a simple
manner. We demonstrate that our approach is valid by reproducing the signals

of complex systems. When the state variable of a unit crosses a threshold, the
unit sends a pulse that is received by other units, thereby mediating the
interactions. At the same time, the state variable of the sending unit is
reset. Here we study pulse-coupled models with a reset that may be partial only
and is mediated by a partial reset function. Such a partial reset characterizes
intrinsic physical or biophysical features of a unit (e.g., resistive coupling
between dendrite and soma of compartmental neurons) and at the same time makes
possible a rigorous mathematical investigation of the collective network
dynamics.
  The partial reset acts as a desynchronization mechanism. For all-to-all
pulse-coupled oscillators an increase in the strength of the partial reset
causes a sequence of desynchronizing bifurcations from the fully synchronous
state via states with large clusters of synchronized units through states with
smaller clusters to complete asynchrony. We analytically derive sufficient and
necessary conditions for the existence and stability of periodic cluster states
on the local dynamics of the oscillators and on the partial reset function to
reveal the mechanism underlying the desynchronization transition. We show that
the entire sequence may occur due to arbitrarily small changes of the partial

physical system is governed by the radiative, nonideal magnetohydrodynamic
(RMHD) equations. The magnetic flux is not assumed to be frozen in any of the
charged species. Its evolution is determined by a newly-derived generalized
Ohm's law, which accounts for the contributions of both elastic and inelastic
collisions to ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation. The species abundances
are calculated using an extensive chemical-equilibrium network. Both MRN and
uniform grain size distributions are considered. The thermal evolution of the
protostellar core and its effect on the dynamics are followed by employing the
grey flux-limited diffusion approximation. Realistic temperature-dependent
grain opacities are used that account for a variety of grain compositions. We
have augmented the publicly-available Zeus-MP code to take into consideration
all these effects and have modified several of its algorithms to improve
convergence, accuracy and efficiency. Results of magnetic star formation
simulations that accurately track the evolution of a protostellar fragment from
a density ~10^3 cm^-3 to a density ~10^15 cm^-3, while rigorously accounting

of two possible hypothesis for its origin: A starspot or a second transiting
planet. We made use of several transit observations of TrES-1 from space with
the HST and from ground with the IAC-80 telescope. On the basis of these
observations we did a statistical study of flux variations in each of the
observed events, to investigate if similar flux increases are present in other
parts of the data set. The HST observation presents a single clear flux rise
during a transit whereas the ground observations led to the detection of two
such events but with low significance. In the case of having observed a
starspot in the HST data, assuming a central impact between the spot and
TrES-1, we would obtain a lower limit for the spot radius of 42000 km. For this
radius the spot temperature would be 4690 K, 560 K lower then the stellar
surface of 5250 K. For a putative second transiting planet we can set a lower
limit for its radius at 0.37 R$_J$ and for periods of less than 10.5 days, we
can set an upper limit at 0.72 R$_J$. Assuming a conventional interpretation,
then this HST observation constitutes the detection of a starspot.
Alternatively, this flux rise might also be caused by an additional transiting
planet. The true nature of the origin can be revealed if a wavelength
dependency of the flux rise can be shown or discarded with a higher certainty.
Additionally, the presence of a second planet can also be detected by radial
velocity measurements.

cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation code {\small
GADGET}. It is based on a fast, robust and photon-conserving integration scheme
where the radiation transport problem is approximated in terms of moments of
the transfer equation and by using a variable Eddington tensor as a closure
relation, following the `OTVET'-suggestion of Gnedin & Abel. We derive a
suitable anisotropic diffusion operator for use in the SPH discretization of
the local photon transport, and we combine this with an implicit solver that
guarantees robustness and photon conservation. This entails a matrix inversion
problem of a huge, sparsely populated matrix that is distributed in memory in
our parallel code. We solve this task iteratively with a conjugate gradient
scheme. Finally, to model photon sink processes we consider ionisation and
recombination processes of hydrogen, which is represented with a chemical
network that is evolved with an implicit time integration scheme. We present
several tests of our implementation, including single and multiple sources in
static uniform density fields with and without temperature evolution, shadowing
by a dense clump, and multiple sources in a static cosmological density field.
All tests agree quite well with analytical computations or with predictions
from other radiative transfer codes, except for shadowing. However, unlike most
other radiative transfer codes presently in use for studying reionisation, our
new method can be used on-the-fly during dynamical cosmological simulation,
allowing simultaneous treatments of galaxy formation and the reionisation
process of the Universe.

desirable to find natural partitions into communities that can act as
simplified descriptions and provide insight into the structure and function of
the overall system. Although community detection methods abound, there is a
lack of consensus on how to quantify and rank the quality of partitions. We
show here that the quality of a partition can be measured in terms of its
stability, defined in terms of the clustered autocovariance of a Markov process
taking place on the graph. Because the stability has an intrinsic dependence on
time scales of the graph, it allows us to compare and rank partitions at each
time and also to establish the time spans over which partitions are optimal.
Hence the Markov time acts effectively as an intrinsic resolution parameter
that establishes a hierarchy of increasingly coarser clusterings. Within our
framework we can then provide a unifying view of several standard partitioning
measures: modularity and normalized cut size can be interpreted as one-step
time measures, whereas Fiedler's spectral clustering emerges at long times. We
apply our method to characterize the relevance and persistence of partitions
over time for constructive and real networks, including hierarchical graphs and
social networks. We also obtain reduced descriptions for atomic level protein
structures over different time scales.

in the presence of moderate rotation down to Rossby numbers of 0.03, as can be
encountered in the Earth atmosphere and oceans. We provide several classical
measures of the degree of anisotropy of the small scales of the flows under
study and conclude that an isotropic model may suffice at moderate Rossby
numbers. The model, developed previously (Baerenzung et al., Phys. Rev. E 77,
046303 (2008)), incorporates eddy viscosity that depends dynamically on the
inertial index of the energy spectrum, as well as eddy noise. We show that the
model reproduces satisfactorily all large-scale properties of the direct
numerical simulations up to Reynolds numbers of the order of 10000 and for long
times after the onset of the inverse cascade of energy at low Rossby number.

X-ray bolometric correction factor L_bol/L_x increases with the Eddington

X-ray spectral index. These observational features provide very useful
constraints on the accretion disc-corona model for AGN. We construct an
accretion disc-corona model and calculate the spectra with different magnetic
stress tensors in the cold discs, in which the corona is assumed to be heated
by the reconnection of the magnetic fields generated by buoyancy instability in
the cold accretion disc. Our calculations show that the magnetic stress tensor
\alpha p_gas fails to explain all these observational features, while \alpha
p_tot always leads to constant L_bol/L_x independent of the Eddington ratio.
The resulted spectra of the disc-corona systems with \alpha (p_gas p_tot)^1/2

qualitatively consistent with the observations. We find that the disc-corona

from the sources accreting at low rates, which may imply the different
accretion mode in these low luminosity sources. We suggest that the disc-corona
system transits to an advection-dominated accretion flow+disc corona system at
low accretion rates, which may be able to explain all the above-mentioned

angular rotation rate Omega to explore environmental dependencies, and analyze
the steady-state properties of each model. Among other statistics, we evaluate
turbulent amplitudes, virial ratios, Toomre Q parameters including turbulence,

self-regulation via turbulent feedback. We also test how the star formation

the star formation rate is proportional to the mass at densities above n_th

at a collisionless, relatively low Alfven Mach number (M_A=5), perpendicular

the shock front of perpendicular shocks has a dynamic rippled character along
the shock surface of low-Mach-number perpendicular shocks. In this paper, the
effect of the rippling of perpendicular shocks on the electron acceleration is
examined by means of large-scale (ion-scale) two-dimensional full particle
simulations. It has been shown that a large-amplitude electric field is excited
at the shock front in association with the ion-scale rippling, and that
reflected ions are accelerated upstream at a localized region where the
shock-normal electric field of the rippled structure is polarized upstream. The
current-driven instability caused by the highly-accelerated reflected ions has
a high growth rate to large-amplitude electrostatic waves. Energetic electrons
are then generated by the large-amplitude electrostatic waves via electron
surfing acceleration at the leading edge of the shock transition region. The
present result suggests that the electron surfing acceleration is also a common
feature at low-Mach-number perpendicular collisionless shocks.

orbiting in model disk galaxies to study the relationships among pressure, the
vertical gas distribution, and the ratio of dense to diffuse gas. We show that
the disk height and mean midplane pressure are consistent with effective
hydrostatic equilibrium, provided that the turbulent vertical velocity
dispersion and gas self-gravity are included. Mass-weighted pressures are an
order of magnitude higher than the midplane pressure because self-gravity
concentrates gas and increases the pressure in clouds. We also investigate the
ratio Rmol=M(H2)/M(HI) for our simulations. Blitz and Rosolowsky (2006) showed
that Rmol is proportional to the estimated midplane pressure. For model series
in which the epicyclic frequency, kappa, and gas surface density, Sigma, are
proportional, we recover the empirical relation. For other model series in
which kappa and Sigma are independent, the midplane pressure and Rmol are not
well correlated. We conclude that the molecular fraction -- and star formation
rate -- of a galactic disk inherently depends on its rotational state, not just
the local values of Sigma and the stellar density rho*. The empirical
correlation between Rmol and midplane pressure implies that the ""environmental
parameters"" kappa, Sigma, and rho* are interdependent in real galaxies,
presumably as a consequence of evolution toward states with Toomre Q near
unity. We note that Rmol in static models far exceeds both the values in our
turbulent simulations and observed values, implying that turbulence is crucial
to obtaining a realistic molecular fraction in the ISM.

power-law relation with the temperature T, dN ~ T^-b dT--with n(H2) ~ 10^3
cm^-3, b ~ 3, and N(H2 ;T > 100K) ~ 3x10^20 cm^-2. The derived b value may be
understood by a bow shock picture, whose shape is cycloidal (cuspy) rather than
paraboloidal. However, this picture raises another issue that the bow shocks
must reside within ~0.01 pc size-scale, smaller than the theoretically
expected. Instead, we conjectured a shocked clumpy interstellar medium picture,
which may avoid the sizescale issue while explaining the similar model
parameters. The observed H2 v = 1 -> 0 S(1) intensities are a factor of ~17 -
33 greater than the prediction from the power-law admixture model. This excess
may be attributed to either an extra component of hot H2 gas or to the effects
of collisions with hydrogen atoms, omitted in our power-law admixture model,

access channel with generalized feedback (MAC-GF) and the two-user interference
channel with generalized feedback (IC-GF). These outer bounds are based on the
idea of dependence balance which was proposed by Hekstra and Willems [1]. To
illustrate the usefulness of our outer bounds, we investigate three different
channel models. We first consider a Gaussian MAC with noisy feedback (MAC-NF),
where transmitter $k$, $k=1,2$, receives a feedback $Y_{F_{k}}$, which is the
channel output $Y$ corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise $Z_{k}$. As the
feedback noise variances become large, one would expect the feedback to become
useless, which is not reflected by the cut-set bound. We demonstrate that our
outer bound improves upon the cut-set bound for all non-zero values of the
feedback noise variances. Moreover, in the limit as $\sigma_{Z_{k}}^{2}\to
\infty$, $k=1,2$, our outer bound collapses to the capacity region of the
Gaussian MAC without feedback. Secondly, we investigate a Gaussian MAC with
user-cooperation (MAC-UC), where each transmitter receives an additive white
Gaussian noise corrupted version of the channel input of the other transmitter
[2]. For this channel model, the cut-set bound is sensitive to the cooperation
noises, but not sensitive enough. For all non-zero values of cooperation noise
variances, our outer bound strictly improves upon the cut-set outer bound.
Thirdly, we investigate a Gaussian IC with user-cooperation (IC-UC). For this
channel model, the cut-set bound is again sensitive to cooperation noise
variances but not sensitive enough. We demonstrate that our outer bound
strictly improves upon the cut-set bound for all non-zero values of cooperation

recent interest as an alternative to gasoline for use in spark ignition engines
and as a possible blending compound with fossil diesel or biodiesel. Therefore,
the autoignition of the four isomers of butanol (1-butanol, 2-butanol,
iso-butanol, and tert-butanol) has been experimentally studied at high
temperatures in a shock tube and a kinetic mechanism for description of their
high-temperature oxidation has been developed. Ignition delay times for
butanol/oxygen/argon mixtures have been measured behind reflected shock waves
at temperatures and pressures ranging from approximately 1200 to 1800 K and 1
to 4 bar. Electronically excited OH emission and pressure measurements were
used to determine ignition delay times. A detailed kinetic mechanism has been
developed to describe the oxidation of the butanol isomers and validated by
comparison to the shock tube measurements. Reaction flux and sensitivity
analysis indicate that the consumption of 1 butanol and iso-butanol, the most
reactive isomers, takes place primarily by H-atom abstraction resulting in the
formation of radicals, the decomposition of which yields highly reactive
branching agents, H-atoms and OH radicals. Conversely, the consumption of tert
butanol and 2-butanol, the least reactive isomers, takes place primarily via
dehydration, resulting in the formation of alkenes, which lead to resonance
stabilized radicals with very low reactivity. To our knowledge, the ignition
delay measurements and oxidation mechanism presented here for 2-butanol,
iso-butanol, and tert butanol are the first of their kind..

by making use of the underlying sl(2,R)-coalgebra symmetry of H in order to
obtain a set of (2N-3) functionally independent integrals of the motion, that

self-organized critical motion. We study static avalanches, or shocks, defined
here as jumps between distinct global minima upon changing an external field.
We show how the full statistics of these jumps is encoded in the
functional-renormalization-group fixed-point functions. This allows us to
obtain the size distribution P(S) of static avalanches in an expansion in the
internal dimension d of the interface. Near and above d=4 this yields the
mean-field distribution P(S) ~ S^(-3/2) exp(-S/[4 S_m]) where S_m is a
large-scale cutoff, in some cases calculable. Resumming all 1-loop
contributions, we find P(S) ~ S^(-tau) exp(C (S/S_m)^(1/2) -B/4 (S/S_m)^delta)
where B, C, delta, tau are obtained to first order in epsilon=4-d. Our result
is consistent to O(epsilon) with the relation tau = 2-2/(d+zeta), where zeta is
the static roughness exponent, often conjectured to hold at depinning. Our
calculation applies to all static universality classes, including random-bond,
random-field and random-periodic disorder. Extended to long-range elastic
systems, it yields a different size distribution for the case of contact-line
elasticity, with an exponent compatible with tau=2-1/(d+zeta) to
O(epsilon=2-d). We discuss consequences for avalanches at depinning and for
sandpile models, relations to Burgers turbulence and the possibility that the
above relations for tau be violated to higher loop order. Finally, we show that
the avalanche-size distribution on a hyper-plane of co-dimension one is in
mean-field (valid close to and above d=4) given by P(S) ~ K_{1/3}(S)/S, where K
is the Bessel-K function, thus tau=4/3 for the hyper plane.

studied by an exact diagonalization method for two electrons in laterally
coupled quantum dots (QD's). We have performed a systematic study of several
nanodevices that contain two gate-defined QD's with different shapes and sizes
located between source and drain contacts. The confinement potential is
modelled by two potential wells with a variable range and softness. In all the
considered nanodevices, the overall dependence of exchange energy $J$ on
electric field $F$ is similar, i.e., for low fields $J$ increases with
increasing $F$, for intermediate fields $J$ reaches a maximum, and rapidly
falls down to zero if $F$ exceeds a certain critical value. However, the $J(F)$
dependence shows characteristic properties that depend on the nanodevice
geometry. We have found that the low- and intermediate-field behaviour can be
accurately parametrized by linear function $J(F) = \\alpha F + \\beta$, where $
alpha$ is independent of the nanodevice geometry and softness of the
confinement potential. We have shown that the linear $J(F)$ dependence appears
only if the tunnel coupling between the QD's is weak, i.e., the interdot
separation is sufficiently large. The $J(F)$ dependence becomes non-linear for
the strong interdot tunnel coupling. If the QD located near the contact, to
which the higher voltage is applied, possesses the elliptic shape and is larger
than the other QD, the $J(F)$ dependence shows a plateau in a broad
electric-field regime. The linearity and rapid jumps of $J(F)$ as well as the
existence of the plateau can be applied to tune the exchange interaction by
changing the external electric field.

Here we develop a self-similar model of the foreshock region and calculate its
structure, e.g., the magnetic field strength, its coherence scale, etc., as a
function of the distance from the shock. Our model indicates that the entire
foreshock region of thickness $\sim R/(2\Gamma_{\rm sh}^2)$, being comparable
to the shock radius in the late afterglow phase when $\Gamma_{\rm sh}\sim1$,
can be populated with large-scale and rather strong magnetic fields (of
sub-gauss strengths with the coherence length of order $10^{17} {\rm cm}$)
compared to the typical interstellar medium magnetic fields. The presence of
such fields in the foreshock region is important for high efficiency of Fermi
acceleration at the shock. Radiation from accelerated electrons in the
foreshock fields can constitute a separate emission region radiating in the
UV/optical through radio band, depending on time and shock parameters. We also
speculate that these fields being eventually transported into the shock
downstream can greatly increase radiative efficiency of a gamma-ray burst

trapping of cold polar molecules, with emphasis on LiH and YbF near an Au
surface at room temperature. We show that for a molecule initially prepared in
its electronic and rovibrational ground state, the Casimir-Polder force
oscillates with the molecule-wall separation. The non-resonant force
contribution and the evanescent part of the resonant force contribution almost
exactly cancel at high temperature which results in a saturation of the
(attractive) force in this limit. A dynamical calculation reveals how the
spatial oscillations die out as thermalisation of the molecule with its
environment sets in.

where the observed abundances cannot be explained by thermal desorption of H2O

efficient non-thermal ice desorption mechanism. Here, we present experimentally
determined UV photodesorption yields of H2O and D2O ice and deduce their
photodesorption mechanism. The ice photodesorption is studied under ultra high
vacuum conditions and at astrochemically relevant temperatures (18-100 K) using
a hydrogen discharge lamp (7-10.5 eV), which simulates the interstellar UV
field. The ice desorption during irradiation is monitored using reflection
absorption infrared spectroscopy of the ice and simultaneous mass spectrometry
of the desorbed species. The photodesorption yield per incident photon is
identical for H2O and D2O and depends on both ice thickness and temperature.
For ices thicker than 8 monolayers the photodesorption yield Y is linearly
dependent on temperature due to increased diffusion of ice species such that
Y(T) = 1E-3(1.3+0.032*T) UV photon-1, with a 60% uncertainty for the absolute
yield. The increased diffusion also results in an increasing H2O:OH desorption
product ratio with temperature. The yield does not depend on the substrate, the
UV photon flux or the UV fluence. The yield is also independent on the initial
ice structure since UV photons efficiently amorphize H2O ice. The results are
consistent with theoretical predictions of H2O photodesorption and partly in
agreement with a previous experimental study. Applying the experimentally
determined yield to a Herbig Ae/Be star+disk model shows that UV
photodesorption of ices increases the H2O content by orders of magnitude in the
disk surface region compared to models where non-thermal desorption is ignored.

Rocha [1] for the two-point correlation function of the string tangent vector,
with a power law from length scales of order the string core width up to
horizon scale with evidence to suggest that the small scale structure builds up
from small scales. An analysis of the size distribution of string loops gives a
very low number density, of order 1 per horizon volume, in contrast with
Nambu-Goto simulations. Further, our loop distribution function does not
support the detailed analytic predictions for loop production derived by Dubath
et al. [2]. Better agreement to our data is found with a model based on loop
fragmentation [3], coupled with a constant rate of energy loss into massive
radiation. Our results show a strong energy loss mechanism which allows the
string network to scale without gravitational radiation, but which is not due
to the production of string width loops. From evidence of small scale structure
we argue a partial explanation for the scale separation problem of how energy
in the very low frequency modes of the string network is transformed into the
very high frequency modes of gauge and Higgs radiation. We propose a picture of

large thermal bath. Our analysis of the initial value problem is based on
Kadanoff-Baym equations which are shown to be equivalent to a stochastic
Langevin equation. The interaction with the thermal bath generates a
temperature-dependent spectral density, either through decay and inverse decay
processes or via Landau damping. In equilibrium, energy density and pressure
are determined by the Bose-Einstein distribution function evaluated at a
complex quasi-particle pole. The time evolution of the statistical propagator
is compared with solutions of the Boltzmann equations for particles as well as
quasi-particles. The dependence on initial conditions and the range of validity
of the Boltzmann approximation are determined.

as muons (or ""photo-muons"") of two Fermi gamma burst monitor (GBM) events,
trigger bn081120618 and trigger bn081124060. In both cases, the trigger
coordinates are within the field of view of the vertical Tupi telescope located
at sea level and inside the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. We show that
despite the first trigger being classified as GRB (due to a gamma ray burst),
with an 100% probability assigned by GBM Flight Software, the trigger time
14:49:31 UT happened during particle precipitations in the SAA, which in most
cases is $\sim 12h$ UT to $\sim 22h$ UT, and the probability of the trigger
being attributed to particle precipitation, according to our analysis is 25%.
The second Fermi trigger is also classified as GRB, with a 100% probability
assigned by GBM Flight Software. The trigger time is 01:26:07 UT, which is
outside the schedule of precipitation of particles. Another important observed
characteristic is the existence of a ground level enhancement (GLE) with a
sharp peak ($5.1\sigma$) coinciding with the Fermi trigger within the 10-second
counting interval (raw data) of the vertical Tupi telescope. In addition it is
possible to identify other GLEs before and after the trigger occurrence. In
both cases, the scenario is similar to the long-duration GeV GRBs observed by
EGRET within the BATSE field of view.

mass, imposed by black hole physics in theories with N species, has an
independent justification from quantum information theory. First, this scale
marks the limiting capacity of any information processor. Secondly, by taking
into the account the limitations of the quantum information storage in any
system with species, the bound on the gravity cutoff becomes equivalent to the
holographic bound, and this equivalence automatically implies the equality of
entanglement and Bekenstein-Hawking entropies. Next, the same bound follows
from quantum cloning theorem. Finally, we point out that by identifying the UV
and IR threshold scales of the black hole quasi-classicality in
four-dimensional field and high-dimensional gravity theories, the bound
translates as the correspondence between the two theories. In case when the
high-dimensional background is AdS, this reproduces the well-known AdS/CFT
relation, but also suggests a generalization of the correspondence beyond AdS
spaces. In particular, it reproduces a recently suggested duality between a
four-dimensional CFT and a flat five dimensional theory, in which gravity
crosses over from four to five dimensional regime in far infrared.

representation of the density matrix as a functional integral. We identify the
stochastic variable of the effective statistical theory that we derive as a
boundary configuration and a zero mode relevant to the discussion of infrared
physics. We illustrate our formulation by computing the partition function of
an interacting one-dimensional quantum mechanical system at finite temperature
from the path-integral representation for the density matrix. The method of
calculation provides an alternative to the usual sum over periodic
trajectories: it sums over paths with coincident endpoints, and includes
non-vanishing boundary terms. An appropriately modified expansion into
Matsubara modes provides a natural separation of the zero-mode physics. This
feature may be useful in the treatment of infrared divergences that plague the
perturbative approach in thermal field theory.
