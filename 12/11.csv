evolution of large-scale magnetic fields in turbulent convection. Methods: We
use the test field method together with 3D numerical simulations of turbulent
convection with shear and rotation to compute turbulent transport coefficients
describing the evolution of large-scale magnetic fields in mean-field theory in
the kinematic regime. 1D mean-field models are used with the derived turbulent
transport coefficients to compare with direct simulations. Results: The
alpha-effect increases monotonically as rotation increases. Turbulent
diffusivity, eta_t, is proportional to the square of the turbulent vertical
velocity. Whereas eta_t decreases approximately inversely proportional to the
wavenumber of the field, the alpha-effect and turbulent pumping show a more
complex behaviour. In the presence of shear and no rotation a small
alpha-effect is induced which does not seem to show any consistent trend as a
function of shear. If the shear is large enough, this small alpha is able to
excite a dynamo in the mean-field model. The coefficient responsible for
driving the shear-current effect shows several sign changes as a function of
depth but is also able to contribute to dynamo action in the mean-field model.
The growth rates in these cases are well below those in direct simulations
suggesting that an incoherent alpha-shear dynamo may also act in them. If both
rotation and shear are present, the alpha-effect is more pronounced. The
combination of the shear-current and Omega x J-effects is also stronger than in
the case of shear only, but subdominant to the alpha-shear dynamo. The results
of direct simulations are consistent with mean-field models where all of these
effects are taken into account without the need to invoke incoherent effects.

masses and mixings. The masses and mixings of all Standard Model (SM) charged
fermions other than top arise from higher dimensional operators involving a
messenger scalar S and flavon scalars F_i. The flavons spontaneously break SM
flavor symmetries at around the TeV scale. The SM singlet scalar S couples
directly to the Higgs H and spontaneously breaks another U(1) at the
electroweak scale. At the TeV scale, SM quarks and charged leptons have
renormalizable couplings to S, but not to H or F_i. These couplings involve new
heavy vectorlike fermions. Integrating out these fermions produces a pattern of
higher dimensional operators that reproduce the observed hierarchies of the SM
masses and mixings in terms of powers of the ""little hierarchy"": the ratio of
the electroweak scale to the flavor-breaking scale.
  The framework has important phenomenological implications. Flavor-changing
neutral currents are within experimental limits but D^0 mixing and B_s->mu+mu-
could be close to current sensitivities. The neutral scalar s of the messenger
field mixes with the light Higgs of the SM, which can have strong effects on
Higgs decay branching fractions. The s mass eigenstate may be lighter than the
Higgs, and could be detected at the Tevatron or the LHC.

two-point weak lensing shear statistics.
  We use a set of realistic image simulations produced by the STEP

define biased two-point weak lensing statistics and perform a likelihood
analysis for two fiducial surveys. We present a derivation of the covariance
matrix for tomography in real space and a fitting formula to calibrate it for
non-Gaussianity.
  We find the biased aperture mass dispersion is reduced by ~20% at redshift
~1, and has a shallower scaling with redshift. This effect, if ignored in data
analyses, biases sigma_8 and w_0 estimates by a few percent. The power of
tomography is significantly reduced when marginalising over a range of
realistic shape measurement biases. For a CFHTLS-Wide-like survey, [Omega_m,
sigma_8] confidence regions are degraded by a factor of 2, whereas for a
KIDS-like survey the factor is 3.5. Our results are strictly valid only for KSB
methods but they demonstrate the need to marginalise over a redshift-dependent

be approximated by a complicated potential, we study the density perturbations
in multi-field inflation with a random potential. The random potential causes
the inflaton to undergo a Brownian motion with a drift in the D-dimensional
field space. To quantify such an effect, we employ a stochastic approach to
evaluate the two-point and three-point functions of primordial perturbations.
We find that in the weakly random scenario the resulting power spectrum
resembles that of the single field slow-roll case, with up to 2% more red tilt.
The strongly random scenario, leads to rich phenomenologies, such as primordial
fluctuations in the power spectrum on all angular scales. Such features may
already be hiding in the error bars of observed CMB TT (as well as TE and EE)
power spectrum and can be detected or falsified with more data coming in the
future. The tensor power spectrum itself is free of fluctuations and the tensor
to scalar ratio is enhanced. In addition a large negative running of the power
spectral index is possible. Non-Gaussianity is generically suppressed by the
growth of adiabatic perturbations on super-horizon scales, but can possibly be
enhanced by resonant effects or arise from the entropic perturbations during
the onset of (p)reheating. The formalism developed in this paper can be applied
to a wide class of multi-field inflation models including, e.g. the N-flation
scenario.

introduce a realization of the corresponding categorical algebra of
compositions, which naturally gives rise to the fundamental quantum laws, thus
indicating category theory as the foundation of Quantum Mechanics. The same
relational algebra generates a number of group structures, among them
$W_{\infty}$. The group $W_{\infty}$ is embodied and realized by the matrix

three-dimensional Ising-like system in a homogeneous external field is
developed in the higher non-Gaussian approximation (the $\rho^6$ model) at
temperatures above the critical value of $T_c$ ($T_c$ is the phase-transition
temperature in the absence of an external field). The free energy of the system
is found by separating the contributions from the short- and long-wave
spin-density oscillation modes taking into account both the temperature and
field fluctuations of the order parameter. Our analytical calculations do not
involve power series in the scaling variable and are valid in the whole
field-temperature plane near the critical point including the region in the
vicinity of the limiting field $\tilde h_c$, which divides external fields into
the weak and strong ones (i.e., the crossover region). In this region, the
temperature and field effects on the system are equivalent, the scaling
variable is of the order of unity, and power series are not efficient. The
obtained expression for the free energy contains the leading terms and terms
determining the temperature and field confluent corrections.

identification of pulsation frequencies is complicated by the presence of
irregular variability caused by the star's circumstellar dust disk. The two

radial structure of nearby AGN tori. These putative tori have been studied with
long-baseline infrared (IR) interferometry, but the spatial scales probed are
different for different objects. They are at various distances and also have
different physical sizes which apparently scale with the luminosity of the
central engine. Here we look at interferometric visibilities as a function of
spatial scales normalized by the size of the inner torus radius R_in. This
approximately eliminates luminosity and distance dependence and, thus, provides
a way to uniformly view the visibilities observed for various objects and at
different wavelengths. We can construct a composite visibility curve over a
large range of spatial scales if different tori share a common radial
structure. The currently available observations do suggest model-independently
a common radial surface brightness distribution in the mid-IR that is roughly
of a power-law form r^-2 as a function of radius r, and extends to ~100 times
R_in. Taking into account the temperature decrease toward outer radii with a
simple torus model, this corresponds to the radial surface density distribution
of dusty material directly illuminated by the central engine roughly in the
range between r^0 and r^-1. This should be tested with further data.

the NRQCD matching coefficients at the zeroth order of $m^2/s$ and order by

since the key choice of function can have a large effect on the resultant
cosmological errors. As an alternative we present a functional form filling
technique in which an unknown, residual, systematic is treated as such. Since
the underlying function is unknown we evaluate the effect of every functional
form allowed by the information available (either a hard boundary or some
data). Using a simple toy model we introduce the formalism of functional form
filling. We show that parameter errors can be dramatically affected by the
choice of function in the case of marginalising over a systematic, but that in
contrast the functional form filling approach is independent of the choice of
basis set. We then apply the technique to cosmic shear shape measurement
systematics and show that a shear calibration bias of |m(z)|< 0.001(1+z)^0.7 is
required for a future all-sky photometric survey to yield unbiased cosmological

inflation could naturally explain, not only the presence of this field, but
also the measured value of the dark energy density. The theory is compatible
with all the local gravity tests, and is free from classical or quantum

a high fidelity entangling operation on an optical transition (optical qubit)
with the long coherence times of two 'clock' states in the hyperfine ground
state (hyperfine qubit) by mapping between these two qubits. For state
initialization, state detection, global qubit rotations and mapping operations,
errors smaller than 1% are achieved whereas the entangling gate adds errors of
2.3%. Based on these operations, we create Bell states with a fidelity of
96.9(3)% in the optical qubit and a fidelity of 96.7(3)% when mapped to the
hyperfine states. In the latter case, the entanglement is preserved for 96(3)
ms, exceeding the duration of a single gate operation by three orders of
magnitude.

use a memory function approach to compute the Hall coefficient as a function of

power-law correction to the free-fermion value (band value), with an exponent
depending on the Luttinger parameter $K_{\rho}$. At sufficiently high

discuss the applications to Hall experiments made in quasi 1D organic

massless theory is gauge invariant, Poincare invariant, and unitary. The
breaking of the electroweak symmetry SU_L(2) X U_Y(1) is achieved without a

low energy electroweak data. \Lambda_W ~ 542 GeV is determined at the Z pole by
fitting it to the Z mass m_Z, and anchoring the value of \sin^2\theta_w to its

overview, we will summarize basic concepts from the Langevin theory of

dedicated to relativistic diffusion processes in Minkowski spacetime. Due to
the finiteness of velocities in relativity, nontrivial relativistic Markov
processes in spacetime do not exist; i.e., relativistic generalizations of the
nonrelativistic diffusion equation and its Gaussian solutions must necessarily

are R_s = 0.87 +0.04-0.03 R_sun and M_s = 0.85 +0.11-0.07 M_sun. Our
ground-based photometry reaches 550 ppm at time sampling of ~50 seconds.
Nevertheless, we also report the presence of an instrumental effect on the VLT
that degraded our photometry for the WASP-5 observations. This effect could be
a major problem for similar programs. Our new estimates for the parameters of
the WASP-5 system are R_p = 1.09 +-0.07 R_jup, M_p = 1.58 +0.13-0.10 M_jup,
rho_p = 1.23 +0.26-0.16 rho_jup, R_s = 1.03 +0.06-0.07 R_sun, and M_s = 0.96

this paper a simple model for this result. We consider a shear flow at low

temperature (44 K) and the high fraction ~72 % of its luminosity emitted at
sub-millimeter wavelengths. Its inferred ""internal luminosity"" (0.04 - 0.06
Lsun) using a radiative transfer model under the most plausible assumption of
its distance as 200 pc is much fainter than for a typical protostar, and even
fainter than other VeLLOs studied previously. Note, however, that its inferred
luminosity may be uncertain by a factor of 2-3 if we consider two extreme
values of the distance of L328-IRS (125 or 310 pc). Low angular resolution
observations of CO do not show any clear evidence of a molecular outflow
activity. But broad line widths toward L328, and Spitzer and near-infrared

the existence of outflow activity. Provided that an envelope of at most ~0.1

emission escaping from star-forming systems at low redshift are essential to
understanding the physics of reionization at high redshift (z >~ 6). Some have
suggested reionization is dominated by numerous small galaxies with LyC escape
fractions f_e ~ 10%, while others suggest mini-quasars with higher f_e might
also play a role. At z > 3, direct observation of LyC leakage becomes
progressively more improbable due to the increase of intervening Ly limit
systems, leaving Lya as the primary diagnostic available to the James Webb
Space Telescope for exploring the epoch of reionization. If a quantitative
relationship between escaping LyC and Lya emission can be established at low z,
then the diagnostic power of Lya as a LyC proxy at high z can be fully
realized. Past efforts to detect f_e near z ~ 3 have been fruitful but
observations at low redshift have been less so. We discuss the sensitivity
requirements for detecting LyC leak in the far- and near-UV as a function of
redshift 0.02 < z ~< 3 and f_e >= 0.01 as estimated from UV luminosity
functions. UV observations are essential to understanding of the physics of LyC
escape and the ultimate goal of identifying the source(s) responsible for
reionization.

turbulence introduced by us approximately ten years ago. The model does not
require any plasma effects to be involved in order to make the reconnection
fast. In fact, it shows that the degree of magnetic field stochasticity
controls the reconnection. The turbulence in the model is assumed to be
subAlfvenic, with the magnetic field only slightly perturbed. This ensures that
the reconnection happens in generic astrophysical environments and the model
does not appeal to any unphysical concepts, similar to the turbulent magnetic
diffusivity concept, which is employed in the kinematic magnetic dynamo. The
interest to that model has recently increased due to successful numerical
testings of the model predictions. In view of this, we discuss implications of
the model, including the first-order Fermi acceleration of cosmic rays, that
the model naturally entails, bursts of reconnection, that can be associated
with Solar flares, as well as, removal of magnetic flux during star-formation.

significant reservoir of the ``missing baryons''. However, to fully understand
how these absorbers contribute to the baryon inventory, it is crucial to
determine whether the systems are collisionally ionized or photoionized (or
both). Using the identified intergalactic OVI absorbers as tracers, we search
for the corresponding X-ray absorption lines, which are useful for finding the
missing baryons and for revealing the nature of the OVI absorbers. Stacking the
Chandra grating spectra along six AGN sight lines, we obtain three spectra with
signal-to-noise ratios of 32, 28, and 10 per 12.5 mA spectral bin around the
expected OVII Kalpha wavelength. These spectra correspond to OVI absorbers with
various dynamic properties. We find no detectable NeIX, OVII, OVIII, NVII, or
CVI absorption lines in the spectra, but the high counting statistics allows us
to obtain firm upper limits on the corresponding ionic column densities (in
particular N(OVII)<=10 N(OVI) on average at the 95% confidence level). Jointly
analyzing these non-detected X-ray lines with the averaged OVI column density,
we further limit the average temperature of the OVI-bearing gas to be
log[T(K)]<=5.7 in collisional ionization equilibrium. We discuss the
implications of these results for physical properties of the putative warm-hot
intergalactic medium and its detection in future X-ray observations.

to date of an intermediate redshift galaxy cluster, the z=0.834 cluster RX
J0152.7-1357. We use the colors of galaxies, assembled from a D~12 Mpc region
centered on the cluster, to investigate the properties of the red-sequence as a
function of density and clustercentric radius. Our wide-field multi-slit survey
with a low-dispersion prism in the IMACS spectrograph at Magellan allowed us to
identify 475 new members of the cluster and its surrounding large scale
structure with a redshift accuracy of dz/(1+z)~1% and a contamination rate of
~2% for galaxies with i<23.75 mag. We combine these new members with the 279
previously known spectroscopic members to give a total of 754 galaxies from
which we obtain a mass-limited sample of 300 galaxies with stellar masses
M>4x10^{10} M_sun. We find that the red galaxy fraction is 93+/-3% in the two
merging cores of the cluster and declines to a level of 64+/-3% at projected
clustercentric radii R>~3 Mpc. At these large projected distances, the
correlation between clustercentric radius and local density is nonexistent.
This allows an assessment of the influence of the local environment on galaxy
evolution, as opposed to mechanisms that operate on cluster scales. Even beyond
R>3 Mpc we find an increasing fraction of red galaxies with increasing local
density. The red fraction at the highest local densities in two groups at R>3
Mpc matches the red fraction found in the two cores. Strikingly, galaxies at
intermediate densities at R>3 Mpc, that are not group members, also show signs
of an enhanced red fraction. Our results point to such intermediate density
regions and the groups in the outskirts of the cluster, as sites where the
local environment influences the transition of galaxies onto the red-sequence.

WINGS (WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey) clusters, a program called
WINGS-SPE. The WINGS-SPE sample consists of 48 clusters, 22 of which are in the
southern sky and 26 in the north. The main goals of this spectroscopic survey
are: (1) to study the dynamics and kinematics of the WINGS clusters and their
constituent galaxies, (2) to explore the link between the spectral properties
and the morphological evolution in different density environments and across a
wide range in cluster X-ray luminosities and optical properties. Methods. Using
multi object fiber fed spectrographs, we observed our sample of WINGS cluster
galaxies at an intermediate resolu- tion of 6-9 A and, using a
cross-correlation technique, we measured redshifts with a mean accuracy of
about 45 km/s. Results. We present redshift measurements for 6137 galaxies and
their first analyses. Details of the spectroscopic observations are reported.
The WINGS-SPE has about 30% overlap with previously published data sets,
allowing us to do both a complete comparison with the literature and to extend
the catalogs. Conclusions. Using our redshifts, we calculate the velocity
dispersion for all the clusters in the WINGS-SPE sample. We almost trip- licate
the number of member galaxies known in each cluster with respect to previous
works. We also investigate the X-ray luminosity vs. velocity dispersion
relation for our WINGS-SPE clusters, and find it to be consistent with the form
Lx proportional to sigma^4.

is initialised with a low entropy hot gas halo that traces the cuspy profile of
the dark matter, and the second is initialised with a high-entropy hot halo
with a cored density profile as might be expected in models with pre-heating
feedback. Galaxy formation proceeds in dramatically different fashion depending
on the initial setup. While the low-entropy halo cools rapidly, primarily from
the central region, the high-entropy halo is quasi-stable for ~4 Gyr and
eventually cools via the fragmentation and infall of clouds from ~100 kpc
distances. The low-entropy halo's X-ray surface brightness is ~100 times
brighter than current limits and the resultant disc galaxy contains more than
half of the system's baryons. The high-entropy halo has an X-ray brightness
that is in line with observations, an extended distribution of
pressure-confined clouds reminiscent of observed populations, and a final disc
galaxy that has half the mass and ~50% more specific angular momentum than the
disc formed in the low-entropy simulation. The final high-entropy system
retains the majority of its baryons in a low-density hot halo. The hot halo
harbours a trace population of cool, mostly ionised, pressure-confined clouds
that contain ~10% of the halo's baryons after 10 Gyr of cooling. The covering
fraction for HI and MgII absorption clouds in the high-entropy halo is ~0.4 and
~0.6, respectively, although most of the mass that fuels disc growth is
ionised, and hence would be under counted in HI surveys.

element of a distributive bounded lattice $L$. These notions prove to have a
good behavior when $L$ is a co-Heyting algebra. In this case the codimension
gives rise to a pseudometric on $L$ which satisfies the ultrametric triangle
inequality. We prove that the Hausdorff completion of $L$ with respect to this
pseudometric is precisely the projective limit of all its finite dimensional
quotients. This completion has some familiar metric properties, such as the
convergence of every monotonic sequence in a compact subset. It coincides with
the profinite completion of $L$ if and only if it is compact or equivalently if
every finite dimensional quotient of $L$ is finite. In this case we say that
$L$ is precompact. If $L$ is precompact and Hausdorff, it inherits many of the
remarkable properties of its completion, specially those regarding the
join/meet irreducible elements. Since every finitely presented co-Heyting
algebra is precompact Hausdorff, all the results we prove on the algebraic
structure of the latter apply in particular to the former. As an application,
we obtain the existence for every positive integers $n,d$ of a term $t_{n,d}$

the EWs more robustly than the side-band method, minimising the effect from
neighbouring absorption lines and reducing the age-metallicity degeneracy. We
concentrate on Balmer lines (Hbeta,Hgamma,Hdelta), the G band and the 4000A
break as age-sensitive indicators, and on the combination [MgFe] as the main
metallicity indicator. We go beyond the standard comparison of the observations
with simple stellar populations (SSP) and consider various models to describe
the star formation histories, either with a continuous star formation rate or
with a mixture of two different SSPs. Composite models are found to give more
consistent fits among individual line strengths and agree with an independent
estimate using the spectral energy distribution. Our age and metallicity
estimates correlate well with stellar mass or velocity dispersion, with a
significant threshold around 5E10 Msun above which galaxies are uniformly old
and metal rich. In a more speculative way, our models suggest that it is
formation **epoch** and not formation timescale what drives the Mass-Age
relationship of elliptical galaxies.

averaged values, a variation that can only be partly explained by triaxiality
and the presence of subhaloes. The mass density appears smooth in the central
relaxed regions but spans four orders of magnitude in the outskirts, both
because of the presence of subhaloes as well as of underdense regions and holes
in the matter distribution. In the inner regions the local velocity dispersion
ellipsoid is aligned with the shape ellipsoid of the halo. This is not true in
the outer parts where the orientation becomes more isotropic. The clumpy
structure in local velocity space of the outer halo can not be well described
by a smooth multivariate normal distribution. Via Lactea II also shows the
presence of cold streams made visible by their high 6D phase space density.
Generally, the structure of dark matter haloes shows a high degree of

properties of 10 red QSOs (J-K>2, R-K>5) selected by combining the 2MASS in the
NIR with the SDSS at optical wavelengths. Optical and/or near-infrared spectra
are available for 8/10 sources. Modeling the SED from UV to far-IR shows that
moderate dust reddening (A_V=1.3-3.2) can explain the red optical and near-IR
colours of the sources in the sample. There is also evidence that red QSOs have
60/12micron luminosity ratio higher than PG QSOs (97% significance). This can
be interpreted as a higher level of star-formation in these systems (measured
by the 60micron luminosity) for a given AGN power (approximated by the 12micron
luminosity). This is consistent with a picture where red QSOs represent an
early phase of AGN evolution, when the supermassive black hole is enshrouded in
dust and gas clouds, which will eventually be blown out (possibly by AGN driven
outflows) and the system will appear as typical optically luminous QSO. There
is also tentative evidence significant at the 96% level that red 2MASS QSOs are
more often associated with radio emission than optically selected SDSS QSOs.
This may indicate outflows, also consistent with the young AGN interpretation.
We also estimate the space density of red QSOs relative to optically selected
SDSS QSOs, taking into account the effect of dust extinction and the intrinsic
luminosity of the sources. We estimate that the fraction of red QSOs in the
overall population increases from 3% at M_K=-27.5mag to 12% at M_K=-29.5mag.
This suggests that reddened QSOs become more important at the bright end of the
Luminosity Function. If red QSOs are transition objects on the way to becoming
typical optically luminous QSOs, the low fractions above suggest that these
systems spent <12% of their lifetime at the ""reddened"" stage.

are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric
bacteria. Since the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells is dependent
on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of
promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration which
is difficult to quantify directly. Here we develop a simple physical model
describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs
transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs non-specifically bound to
DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for E. coli
allow us to determine the two unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce
the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to
predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive
(unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate dependent
regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in
transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth
rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene
expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP
expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the
case of the stringent response following amino acid starvation, we can evaluate
the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control
proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and
biosynthetic operons.

200 nm in diameter, octahedra of size 1 micron, and polyhedra of size 800 nm.
They exhibit a wide spectrum of magnetic properties. At low temperature, T = 5
K, the octahedron sample is diamagnetic. The nanosphere is paramagnetic. The
other two polyhedron samples synthesized in different runs by the same process
are found to show different magnetic properties. One of them exhibits weak
ferromagnetism with T_C = 455 K and saturation magnetization, M_S = 0.19 emu/g
at T = 5 K, while the other is paramagnetic. The total magnetic moment
estimated from the detected impurity concentration of Fe, Co, and Ni, is too
small to account for the observed magnetism by one to two orders of magnitude.
Calculations by the density functional theory (DFT) reveal that cation
vacancies in the Cu2O lattice are one of the possible causes of induced
magnetic moments. The results further predict that the defect-induced magnetic
moments favour a ferromagnetically coupled ground state if the local
concentration of cation vacancies, n_C, exceeds 12.5%. This offers a possible
scenario to explain the observed magnetic properties. The limitations of the
investigations in the present work, in particular in the theoretical
calculations, are discussed and possible areas for further study are suggested.

magnitude lower than expected. This dramatic drop in capacitance is attributed
to the so called dead layer - a low-permittivity layer at the metal-dielectric
interface in series with the high-permittivity dielectric. The exact nature of
the dead layer and the reasons for its origin still remain somewhat unclear.
Based on insights gained from recently published ab initio work on

coupling, are dominant contributors to the dead layer effect. Our theoretical
results compare well with existing as well as our own ab initio calculations

the environment attributed to the nearest neighbor galaxy using the SDSS

characteristic scale where the properties of galaxies suddenly start to depend
on the clustercentric radius at fixed neighbor environment. The characteristic
scale is $1\sim 3$ times the cluster virial radius depending on galaxy
luminosity. Existence of the characteristic scale means that the local galaxy
number density is not directly responsible for the morphology-density relation
in clusters because the local density varies smoothly with the clustercentric
radius and has no discontinuity in general. What is really working in clusters
is the morphology-clustercentric radius-neighbor environment relation, where
the neighbor environment means both neighbor morphology and the local mass
density attributed to the neighbor. The morphology-density relation appears
working only because of the statistical correlation between the nearest
neighbor distance and the local galaxy number density. We find strong evidence
that the hydrodynamic interactions with nearby early-type galaxies is the main
drive to quenching star formation activity of late-type galaxies in clusters.
The hot cluster gas seems to play at most a minor role down to one tenth of the
cluster virial radius. We also find that the viable mechanisms which can
account for the clustercentric radius dependence of the structural and internal
kinematics parameters are harassment and interaction of galaxies with the
cluster potential. The morphology transformation of the late-type galaxies in
clusters seems to have taken place through both galaxy-galaxy hydrodynamic
interactions and galaxy-cluster/galaxy-galaxy gravitational interactions.

sizable and the impurity-induced density of states (DOS) is prominent if $I\sim

power-law temperature dependence in $1/T_1$, a sizable suppression in Tc is
inevitably accompanied. In the unitary scattering regime, in contrast, impurity
effect is very small for both Tc and DOS except at $I=I'$. By comparing theory

the charged lepton spectrum is determined by the vacuum expectation value of a
9-component scalar field \Phi. On the basis of this mechanism, we implement the
following mechanisms into our model: (1) The radiative correction induced by
family gauge interaction cancels the QED radiative correction to Koide's mass
formula, assuming a scenario in which the U(3) family gauge symmetry and
SU(2)_L weak gauge symmetry are unified at 10^2-10^3 TeV scale; (2) A simple

Koide's formula is protected; (3) Koide's formula is stabilized by embedding
U(3) \times SU(2) symmetry in a larger symmetry group. Formally fine tuning of
parameters in the model is circumvented (apart from two exceptions) by
appropriately connecting the charged lepton spectrum to the boundary (initial)

graphs and circular-arc graphs is analyzed. In a graph, a stable set requires
that at most one vertex is chosen for each edge. It is equivalent to requiring
that at most one vertex for each maximal clique is chosen. We show that this
algorithm finds all maximal cliques for interval graphs, i.e. it can compute
the convex hull of the stable set polytope. In case of circular-arc graphs, the
algorithm is not able to detect all maximal cliques, yet remaining correct.
This problem occurs in the context of railway scheduling. A train requests the
allocation of a railway infrastructure resource for a specific time interval.
As one is looking for conflict-free train schedules, the used resource
allocation intervals in a schedule must not overlap. The conflict-free choices
of used intervals for each resource correspond to stable sets in the interval
graph associated to the allocation time intervals.

probability distribution function (PDF) for observationally-derived field
estimates is consistent with a monotonic PDF for actual vertical field
strengths. Hence, the prevalence of weak fields is greater than would be
naively inferred from observations. Secondly, we employ the fractal
self-similar geometry of the turbulent solar magnetic field to derive two
estimates (numerical and observational) of the true mean vertical unsigned flux
density. We also find observational evidence that the scales of magnetic
structuring in the photosphere extend at least down to an order of magnitude
smaller than 200 km: the self-similar power-law scaling in the signed measure
from a Hinode magnetogram ranges (over two decades in length scales and
including the granulation scale) down to the 200 km resolution limit. From the
self-similar scaling, we determine a lower bound for the true quiet-Sun mean
vertical unsigned flux density of ~50 G. This is consistent with our
numerically-based estimates that 80% or more of the vertical unsigned flux
should be invisible to Stokes-V observations at a resolution of 200 km owing to
the cancellation of signal from opposite magnetic polarities. Our estimates
significantly reduce the order-of-magnitude discrepancy between Zeeman- and

establish a link between the fields of classical statistical mechanics and

quantum information techniques to recover well known duality relations and
local symmetries of classical models in a simple way, and provide new classical
simulation methods to simulate certain types of classical spin models. We show

Optical conductivity in this regime shows a two-peak structure. The

originates from coupling to spin-wave excitations, broadened and renormalized

multiperiodicity (or both) in order to explore the possibility of combining
binary star astrophysics with stellar oscillations. Here we present the first
results for ten, predominantly southern, HADS variables. We detected the
orbital motion of RS Gru with a semi-amplitude of ~6.5 km/s and 11.5 days
period. The companion is inferred to be a low-mass dwarf star in a close orbit
around RS Gru. We found multiperiodicity in RY Lep both from photometric and
radial velocity data and detected orbital motion in the radial velocities with
hints of a possible period of 500--700 days. The data also revealed that the
amplitude of the secondary frequency is variable on the time-scale of a few
years, whereas the dominant mode is stable. Radial velocities of AD CMi
revealed cycle-to-cycle variations which might be due to non-radial pulsations.
We confirmed the multiperiodic nature of BQ Ind, while we obtained the first
radial velocity curves of ZZ Mic and BE Lyn. The radial velocity curve and the
O-C diagram of CY Aqr are consistent with the long-period binary hypothesis. We
took new time series photometry on XX Cyg, DY Her and DY Peg, with which we
updated their O-C diagrams.

by around 30 nm were synthesized by means of a mild chemical solution method
using a soft template of trioctylphosphineoxide (TOPO). It was revealed that
the uniform Ni nanochains were capped with Ni3C thin shells by about 1 to 4 nm
in thickness and each Ni core consists of polygrains. The coercivity of the
core-shell nanochains is much enhanced (600 Oe at 5 K) and comparable with
single Ni nanowires due to the one-dimensional shape anisotropy. Deriving from
the distinctive structure of Ni core and Ni3C shell, this architecture may
possess a possible bi-functionality. This unique architecture is also useful
for the study on the magnetization reversal mechanism of one-dimensional
magnetic nanostructure.

systematize the study of constraints placed by astrophysical observations on
the nature of neutron-star matter. To obtain useful constraints, the number of
parameters should be smaller than the number of neutron-star properties that
have been measured or will have been measured in the next several years. And
the set must be large enough to accurately approximate the large set of
candidate EOSs. We find that a parameterized EOS based on piecewise polytropes
with 3 free parameters matches to about 4% rms error an extensive set of
candidate EOSs at densities below the central density of 1.4 solar mass stars.
Adding observations of more massive stars constrains the higher density part of
the EOS and requires an additional parameter. We obtain constraints on the
allowed parameter space set by causality and by present and near-future
astronomical observations. In particular, we emphasize potentially stringent
constraints on the EOS parameter space associated with two measured properties
of a single star; and we find that a measurement of the moment of inertia of
PSR J0737-3039A can strongly constrain the maximum neutron-star mass. We also
present in an appendix a more efficient algorithm than has previously been used
for finding points of marginal stability and the maximum angular velocity of
stable stars.
