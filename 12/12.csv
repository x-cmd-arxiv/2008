polarized thermal emission from dust. Both Galactic synchrotron emission and
polarized thermal emission from dust reflect statistics of magnetic field
fluctuations and, therefore, Galactic turbulence. We mainly focus on the
relation between observed angular spectra and underlying turbulence statistics.
Our major findings are as follows. First, we find that magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) turbulence in the Galaxy can indeed explain diffuse synchrotron emission
from high galactic latitude. Our model calculation suggests that either a
one-component extended halo model or a two-component model, an extended halo
component (scale height > 1kpc) plus a local component, can explain the
observed angular spectrum of the synchrotron emission. However, discrete
sources seem to dominate the spectrum for regions near the Galactic plane.
Second, we study how star-light polarization is related with polarized emission
from thermal dust. We also discuss the expected angular spectrum of polarized
emission from thermal dust. Our model calculations suggest that C_l\propto
l^{-11/3} for l > 1000 and a shallower spectrum for l < 1000.

three-dimensional numerical simulations. This is the first attempt to test a
model of fast magnetic reconnection proposed by Lazarian & Vishniac (1999),
which assumes the presence of weak, small-scale magnetic field structure near
the current sheet. This affects the rate of reconnection by reducing the
transverse scale for reconnection flows and by allowing many independent flux
reconnection events to occur simultaneously. We performed a number of
simulations to test the dependencies of the reconnection speed, defined as the
ratio of the inflow velocity to the Alfven speed, on the turbulence power, the
injection scale and resistivity. Our results show that turbulence significantly
affects the topology of magnetic field near the diffusion region and increases
the thickness of the outflow region. We confirm the predictions of the Lazarian
& Vishniac model. In particular, we report the growth of the reconnection speed
proportional to ~ V^2, where V is the amplitude of velocity at the injection
scale. It depends on the injection scale l as ~ (l/L)^(2/3), where L is the
size of the system, which is somewhat faster but still roughly consistent with
the theoretical expectations. We also show that for 3D reconnection the Ohmic
resistivity is important in the local reconnection events only, and the global
reconnection rate in the presence of turbulence does not depend on it.

X-ray sources, their origin is still a matter of debate. Analytical studies of
hydrodynamic accretion disks have shown three types of trapped global modes
with properties that appear to agree with the observations. However, these
studies take only linear effects into account and do not address the issues of
mode excitation and decay. Moreover, observations suggest that resonances
between modes play a crucial role. A systematic, numerical study of this
problem is therefore needed. In this paper, we use a pseudo-spectral algorithm
to perform a parameter study of the inner regions of hydrodynamic disks. By
assuming alpha-viscosity, we show that steady state solutions rarely exist. The
inner edges of the disks oscillate and excite axisymmetric waves. In addition,
the flows inside the inner edges are sometimes unstable to non-axisymmetric
perturbations. One-armed, or even two-armed, spirals are developed, which
provides a plausible explanation for the high-frequency QPOs observed from
accreting black holes. When the Reynolds numbers are above certain critical
values, the inner disks go through some transient turbulent states
characterized by strong trailing spirals; while large-scale leading spirals
developed in the outer disks. We compared our numerical results with standard
thin disk oscillation models. Although the non-axisymmetric features have their
analytical counterparts, more careful study is needed to explain the
axisymmetric oscillations.

with sources that are only non-zero in the presence of turbulent fluctuations.
We solve these in a shearing box domain using a WKBJ method. It is found that,
for a particular azimuthal wave length, the wave excitation occurs through a
sequence of regularly spaced swings during which the wave changes from leading
to trailing form. This is a generic process that is expected to occur in
shearing discs with turbulence. Trailing waves of equal amplitude propagating
in opposite directions are produced, both of which produce an outward angular
momentum flux that we give expressions for as functions of the disc parameters
and azimuthal wave length.
  By solving the wave amplitude equations numerically we justify the WKBJ
approach for a Keplerian rotation law for all parameter regimes of interest. In
order to quantify the wave excitation completely the important wave source
terms need to be specified. Assuming conditions of weak nonlinearity, these can
be identified and are associated with a quantity related to the potential
vorticity, being the only survivors in the linear regime. Under the additional
assumption that the source has a flat power spectrum at long azimuthal wave
lengths, the optimal azimuthal wave length produced is found to be determined
solely by the WKBJ response and is estimated to be 2 pi H, with H being the

various topological excitations on an R^3 \times S^1 geometry. The index
theorem provides more refined data than the APS index for an instanton on R^4
and reproduces it in decompactification limit. In the R^3 limit, it reduces to
the Callias index theorem. The index is expressed in terms of topological
charge and the eta-invariant associated with the boundary Dirac operator.
Neither topological charge nor eta-invariant is typically an integer, however,
the non-integer parts cancel to give an integer-valued index. Our derivation is
based on axial current non-conservation--an exact operator identity valid on
any four-manifold--and on the existence of a center symmetric, or approximately
center symmetric, boundary holonomy (Wilson line). We expect the index theorem
to usefully apply to many physical systems of interest, such as low temperature
(large S^1, confined) phases of gauge theories, center stabilized Yang-Mills
theories with vector-like or chiral matter (at S^1 of any size), and
supersymmetric gauge theories with supersymmetry-preserving boundary conditions
(also at any S^1). In QCD-like and chiral gauge theories, the index theorem
should shed light into the nature of topological excitations responsible for
chiral symmetry breaking and the generation of mass gap in the gauge sector. We
also show that imposing chirally-twisted boundary condition in gauge theories
with fermions induces a Chern-Simons term in the infrared. This suggests that
some QCD-like gauge theories should possess components with a topological
Chern-Simons phase in the small S^1 regime.

We explore the onset of star formation in the 75 M_sun SMM1 clump in the region
ISOSS J18364-0221 using infrared and (sub-)millimetre observations including
interferometry. This contracting clump has fragmented into two compact cores
SMM1 North and South of 0.05 pc radius, having masses of 15 and 10 M_sun, and
luminosities of 20 and 180 L_sun. SMM1 South harbours a source traced at 24 and
70um, drives an energetic molecular outflow, and appears supersonically
turbulent at the core centre. SMM1 North has no infrared counterparts and shows
lower levels of turbulence, but also drives an outflow. Both outflows appear
collimated and parsec-scale near-infrared features probably trace the
outflow-powering jets. We derived mass outflow rates of at least 4E-5 M_sun/yr
and outflow timescales of less than 1E4 yr. Our HCN(1-0) modelling for SMM1
South yielded an infall velocity of 0.14 km/s and an estimated mass infall rate
of 3E-5 M_sun/yr. Both cores may harbour seeds of intermediate- or high-mass
stars. We compare the derived core properties with recent simulations of
massive core collapse. They are consistent with the very early stages dominated
by accretion luminosity.

conjunctive (CQ) queries, possibly with grouping and aggregation. For SPJ
queries, the semantics of the SQL standard treat query answers as multisets
(a.k.a. bags), whereas the stored relations may be treated either as sets,
which is called bag-set semantics for query evaluation, or as bags, which is
called bag semantics. (Under set semantics, both query answers and stored
relations are treated as sets.)
  In the context of the above Query-Reformulation Problem, we develop a
comprehensive framework for equivalence of CQ queries under bag and bag-set
semantics in presence of embedded dependencies, and make a number of conceptual
and technical contributions. Specifically, we develop equivalence tests for CQ
queries in presence of arbitrary sets of embedded dependencies under bag and
bag-set semantics, under the condition that chase [9] under set semantics

aggregate CQ queries in presence of embedded dependencies. We use our
equivalence tests to develop sound and complete (whenever set-chase on the
inputs terminates) algorithms for solving instances of the Query-Reformulation
Problem with CQ queries under each of bag and bag-set semantics, as well as for
instances of the problem with aggregate queries.

of Higgs fields that break the B-L around one TeV. The dominant mode of dark
matter annihilation is to the lightest of the new Higgs fields, which has a

enhancement of the dark matter annihilation cross section, which can be >~
10^3. For a dark matter mass in the 1-2 TeV range, the model provides a good

the interstellar (IS) dust by a hot star passing through a diffuse IS cloud.
This model is applied to six lambda Bootis stars with infrared excesses.
Plausible values for the IS medium (ISM) density and relative velocity between
the cloud and the star yield fits to the excess emission. This result is
consistent with the diffusion/accretion hypothesis that lambda Bootis stars (A-
to F-type stars with large underabundances of Fe-peak elements) owe their
characteristics to interactions with the ISM. This proposal invokes radiation
pressure from the star to repel the IS dust and excavate a paraboloidal dust
cavity in the IS cloud, while the metal-poor gas is accreted onto the stellar
photosphere. However, the measurements of the infrared excesses can also be fit
by planetary debris disk models. A more detailed consideration of the
conditions to produce lambda Bootis characteristics indicates that the majority
of infrared-excess stars within the Local Bubble probably have debris disks.
Nevertheless, more distant stars may often have excesses due to heating of
interstellar material such as in our model.

and away sides of high-p_T triggers in heavy-ion collisions is studied.
Hadronization of jets on both sides is treated by thermal-shower and
shower-shower recombination. Energy loss of semihard and hard partons
traversing the nuclear medium is parametrized in a way that renders good fit of
the single-particle inclusive distributions at all centralities. The associated
hadron distribution in the near-side jet can be determined showing weak
dependence on system size because of trigger bias. The inverse slope increases
with trigger momentum in agreement with data. The distribution of associated
particle in the away-side jet is also studied with careful attention given to
antitrigger bias that is due to the longer path length that the away-side jet
recoiling against the trigger jet must propagate in the medium to reach the
opposite side. Centrality dependence is taken into account after determining a
realistic probability distribution of the dynamical path length of the parton
trajectory within each class of centrality. For symmetric dijets with
p_T^{trig}=p_T^{assoc}(away) it is shown that the per-trigger yield is
dominated by tangential jets. The average parton momentum for the recoil jet is
shown to be always larger than that of the trigger jet for fixed p_T^{trig} and
centrality and for any measurable p_T^{assoc}(away). With the comprehensive
treatment of dijet production described here it is possible to answer many
questions regarding the behavior of partons in the medium under conditions that
can be specified on measurable hadron momenta.

structure of the proton based directly on QCD are beginning to provide reliable
results. Most of our present knowledge of the structure of the proton is based
on experimental measurements interpreted within the rich framework of QCD. An
area presently attracting intense interest, both experimental and theoretical,
is the relationship between the spin of the proton and the spins and orbital
angular momenta of its constituents. While remarkable progress has been made,
especially in the last decade, the discovery and investigation of new concepts
have revealed that much more remains to be learned. This progress is reviewed
and an outlook for the future is offered.

s-process enrichments of neutron(n)-capture elements that cannot be detected in
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. However, accurate abundance determinations
of these elements present a challenge. Corrections for unobserved ions can be
large and uncertain, since in many PNe only one ion of a given n-capture
element has been detected. Furthermore, the atomic data governing the
ionization balance of these species are not well-determined, inhibiting the
derivation of accurate ionization corrections. We present initial results of a
program that addresses these challenges. Deep high resolution optical
spectroscopy of ~20 PNe has been performed to detect emission lines from
trans-iron species including Se, Br, Kr, Rb, and Xe. The optical spectral
region provides access to multiple ions of these elements, which reduces the
magnitude and importance of uncertainties in the ionization corrections. In
addition, experimental and theoretical efforts are providing determinations of
the photoionization cross-sections and recombination rate coefficients of Se,
Kr, and Xe ions. These new atomic data will make it possible to derive robust
ionization corrections for these elements. Together, our observational and
atomic data results will enable n-capture element abundances to be determined

from large separations through inspiral, merger, and ringdown. We evolve the
metric using the BSSN formulation with the standard moving puncture gauge

orbital angular momentum) by evolving three sets of initial data with BH:NS

varied between a/M = -0.5 (anti-aligned), 0.0, and 0.75. The number of orbits
before merger increases with a/M, as expected. We also study the nonspinning BH
case in more detail, varying q between 1, 3, and 5. We calculate gravitational
waveforms for the cases we simulate and compare them to binary black-hole
waveforms. Only a small disk (< 0.01 M_sun) forms for the anti-aligned spin
case (a/M = -0.5) and for the most extreme mass ratio case (q=5). By contrast,
a massive (M_disk is about 0.2 M_sun), hot disk forms in the rapidly spinning

would be in thermal equilibrium in the early universe and share the same
temperature as active neutrinos, but this is not necessarily the case. In this
work, we fit up-to-date cosmological data with an extended LambdaCDM model,
including light relics with a mass typically in the range 0.1 -10 eV. We
provide, first, some nearly model-independent constraints on their current
density and velocity dispersion, and second, some constraints on their mass,
assuming that they consist either in early decoupled thermal relics, or in
non-resonantly produced sterile neutrinos. Our results can be used for
constraining most particle-physics-motivated models with three active neutrinos
and one extra light species. For instance, we find that at the 3 sigma
confidence level, a sterile neutrino with mass m_s = 2 eV can be accommodated
with the data provided that it is thermally distributed with (T_s/T_nu) < 0.8,
or non-resonantly produced with (Delta N_eff) < 0.5. The bounds become

interpolate between these two regimes adding to the continuum epsilon regime
formulae, in the spirit of the Symanzik expansion, the relevant operators
parametrising the leading cutoff effects. We compute the partition function,
the chiral condensate, scalar and pseudo-scalar correlation functions. The
final formulae can be used to fit lattice data to extract physical low energy

anharmonic oscillators (AO) with a potential $V(x) =\beta x^{2}+x^{2m}$
($m>0$). The method [Nucl. Phys. B801, 296 (2008)], applies a priori to any ODE
with two-point boundaries (one being located at infinity), the solution of
which has singularities in the complex plane of the independent variable $x$. A
conformal mapping of a suitably chosen angular sector of the complex plane of
$x$ upon the unit disc centered at the origin makes convergent the transformed
Taylor series of the generic solution so that the boundary condition at
infinity can be easily imposed. In principle, this constraint, when applied on
the logarithmic-derivative of the wave function, determines the eigenvalues to
an arbitrary level of accuracy. In practice, for $\beta \geq 0$ or slightly
negative, the accuracy of the results obtained is astonishingly large with
regards to the modest computing power used. It is explained why the efficiency
of the method decreases as $\beta $ is more and more negative. Various aspects

size setting. Only a small fraction of the features are useful, the useful
features are unknown to us, and each useful feature contributes weakly to the
classification decision -- this setting was called the rare/weak model (RW
Model). We select features by thresholding feature $z$-scores. The threshold is
set by {\it higher criticism} (HC). Let $\pee_i$ denote the $P$-value
associated to the $i$-th $z$-score and $\pee_{(i)}$ denote the $i$-th order
statistic of the collection of $P$-values. The HC threshold (HCT) is the order
statistic of the $z$-score corresponding to index $i$ maximizing $(i/n -
\pee_{(i)})/\sqrt{\pee_{(i)}(1-\pee_{(i)})}$. The ideal threshold optimizes the
classification error. In \cite{PNAS} we showed that HCT was numerically close
to the ideal threshold. We formalize an asymptotic framework for studying the
RW model, considering a sequence of problems with increasingly many features
and relatively fewer observations. We show that along this sequence, the
limiting performance of ideal HCT is essentially just as good as the limiting
performance of ideal thresholding. Our results describe two-dimensional {\it
phase space}, a two-dimensional diagram with coordinates quantifying ""rare"" and
""weak"" in the RW model. Phase space can be partitioned into two regions -- one
where ideal threshold classification is successful, and one where the features
are so weak and so rare that it must fail. Surprisingly, the regions where
ideal HCT succeeds and fails make the exact same partition of the phase
diagram. Other threshold methods, such as FDR threshold selection, are
successful in a substantially smaller region of the phase space than either HCT
or Ideal thresholding.

out using Markov chain Monte Carlo, in particular either the Glauber dynamics

$n$ is the number of vertices in the graph; in contrast, we show that in the
low temperature regime the mixing is exponentially slow for any local Markov

allows for the growth of a superlattice with stable polarized regions and large
polarization discontinuities at the internal interfaces. We also generalize a
Wannier-based definition of layer polarizations in perovskite superlattices

scattering have so far been unable to conclusively resolve whether a local
moment Heisenberg description applies in parent iron based compounds, or
whether magnetism arises from a collective SDW order instability. These two
alternatives can in principle be distinguished by measuring the low energy

have isolated the complete low-lying bulk representative electronic structure

below T_SDW point uniquely to a nesting driven band hybridization mechanism of

of the form $f_{xc}= \alpha/q^2$ where $q$ is the wave vector and $\alpha$ is a
frequency-dependent coefficient. We show that in the limit of weak
non-uniformity the coefficient $\alpha$ has a simple and exact expression in
terms of the ground-state density and the frequency-dependent kernel of a {\it
uniform} electron gas at the average density. We present an approximate
evaluation of this expression for Si and discuss its implications for the
theory of excitonic effects.

We study various collapse scenarios with ""arbitrary"" angular momentum for a

three-dimensional Kerr-dS spacetime, and an horizonless geometry of point
masses under certain initial conditions. For pressureless dust shells, the
curvature singularity is ""not"" formed due to the angular momentum barrier near
the origin. However when the shell pressure is nonvanishing, we find that for
all types of shells with polytropic-type equations of state (including the
perfect fluid and the generalized Chaplygin gas), collapse to a naked

hole furthest from the receiver. We show that there is a phase relationship of
the primary and secondary pulses that is a probe of the strongly curved

medicine. Support Vector Machines are increasingly popular and efficient and
could replace artificial neural network systems. Here a method to classify
blood cells is proposed using SVM. A set of statistics on images are
implemented in C++. The MPEG-7 descriptors Scalable Color Descriptor, Color
Structure Descriptor, Color Layout Descriptor and Homogeneous Texture
Descriptor are extended in size and combined with textural features
corresponding to textural properties perceived visually by humans. From a set
of images of human blood cells these statistics are collected. A SVM is
implemented and trained to classify the cell images. The cell images come from
a CellaVision DM-96 machine which classify cells from images from microscopy.
The output images and classification of the CellaVision machine is taken as
ground truth, a truth that is 90-95% correct. The problem is divided in two --
the primary and the simplified. The primary problem is to classify the same
classes as the CellaVision machine. The simplified problem is to differ between
the five most common types of white blood cells. An encouraging result is
achieved in both cases -- error rates of 10.8% and 3.1% -- considering that the
SVM is misled by the errors in ground truth. Conclusion is that further
investigation of performance is worthwhile.

systems are expected to advance in two directions: improvements of remote

goal of robots is to allow safer and more homogeneous outcomes with less
variability of surgeon performance, as well as new tools to perform tasks on
the basis of medical transcutaneous imaging, in a less invasive way, at lower
costs. It is expected that improvements for a remote system could be augmented
in reality, with haptic feedback, size reduction, and development of new tools
for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery. The paradigm of
image-guided robots is close to clinical availability and the most advanced
robots are presented with end-user technical assessments. It is also notable
that the potential of robots lies much further ahead than the accomplishments
of the daVinci system. The integration of imaging with robotics holds a
substantial promise, because this can accomplish tasks otherwise impossible.
Image-guided robots have the potential to offer a paradigm shift.

  SAR","14 pages. Submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research (revised)",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations can provide a global
view of ocean swell fields when using a specific ""wave mode"" sampling. A
methodology is presented to routinely derive integral properties of the longer
wavelength (swell) portion of the wave spectrum from SAR Level 2 products, and
both monitor and predict their evolution across ocean basins. SAR-derived
estimates of swell height, and energy-weighted peak period and direction, are
validated against buoy observations, and the peak directions are used to
project the peak periods in one dimension along the corresponding great circle
route, both forward and back in time, using the peak period group velocity. The
resulting real time dataset of great circle-projected peak periods produces
two-dimensional maps that can be used to monitor and predict the spatial
extent, and temporal evolution, of individual ocean swell fields as they
propagate from their source region to distant coastlines. The methodology is
found to be consistent with the dispersive arrival of peak swell periods at a
mid-ocean buoy. The simple great circle propagation method cannot project the
swell heights in space like the peak periods, because energy evolution along a
great circle is a function of the source storm characteristics and the unknown
swell dissipation rate. A more general geometric optics model is thus proposed
for the far field of the storms. This model is applied here to determine the
attenuation over long distances. For one of the largest recorded storms,
observations of 15 s period swells are consistent with a constant dissipation
rate that corresponds to a 3300 km e-folding scale for the energy. In this
case, swell dissipation is a significant term in the wave energy balance at
global scales.

general MIMO case, for which the state-of-the art results are valid only for
nonsingular square channel matrices. Surprisingly, these results do not hold
true when the channel matrices are rectangular and/or rank deficient matrices.
The goal of this paper is to provide a complete characterization of the MIMO
game for arbitrary channel matrices, in terms of conditions guaranteeing both
the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium and the convergence of asynchronous
distributed iterative waterfilling algorithms. Our analysis hinges on new
technical intermediate results, such as a new expression for the MIMO
waterfilling projection valid (also) for singular matrices, a mean-value
theorem for complex matrix-valued functions, and a general contraction theorem
for the multiuser MIMO watefilling mapping valid for arbitrary channel
matrices. The quite surprising result is that uniqueness/convergence conditions
in the case of tall (possibly singular) channel matrices are more restrictive
than those required in the case of (full rank) fat channel matrices. We also
propose a modified game and algorithm with milder conditions for the uniqueness
of the equilibrium and convergence, and virtually the same performance (in

far more robust in the applied field for the case with spin-dependent masses

spin-orbit interaction (which can be tuned by a perpendicular gate voltage) and
the Aharonov-Bohm flux (due to a perpendicular magnetic field) combine to
select only one propagating ballistic mode. For this mode, the electronic spins
are fully polarized along a direction that can be controlled by the electric
and magnetic fields and by the electron energy. All the other modes are
evanescent. Generalizing the square diamonds into rhombi with arbitrary opening

efficient filtering. A different gate voltage on the two sides of each rhombus

GeV, R~0.5 is an appropriate choice, clustering at the TeV scale requires R~1
for optimal efficiency. We finally show that our results are valid in the

various authors but never detected with significance. The stellar wind of the
optical companion is abnormally slow. The orbital period, initially reported to
be 9.6 days, disappeared and a new periodicity of 19.25 days emerged. Our new

higher than previously suggested. The source also shows a soft excess at low

size and temperature of the emitting region agrees with its interpretation in
terms of a hot spot on the neutron star surface. The source displays
variability on time scales of days, presumably due to changes in the mass
accretion rate as the neutron star moves around the optical companion in a
moderately eccentric orbit.

110501 (2008)], the partition function of the 2D square lattice Ising model in
the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field, can specialize to the
partition function of any Ising system on an arbitrary graph. In this sense the
2D Ising model is said to be ""complete"". However, in order to obtain the above
result, the coupling strengths on the 2D lattice must assume complex values,
and thus do not allow for a physical interpretation. Here we show how a
complete model with real -and, hence, ""physical""- couplings can be obtained if
the 3D Ising model is considered. We furthermore show how to map general
q-state systems with possibly many-body interactions to the 2D Ising model with
complex parameters, and give completeness results for these models with real
parameters. We also demonstrate that the computational overhead in these
constructions is in all relevant cases polynomial. These results are proved by
invoking a recently found cross-connection between statistical mechanics and
quantum information theory, where partition functions are expressed as quantum
mechanical amplitudes. Within this framework, there exists a natural
correspondence between many-body quantum states that allow universal quantum
computation via local measurements only, and complete classical spin systems.

were developed and the invariant mass of the photon pairs was reconstructed.
The ($\gamma$,$\gamma$) invariant mass was found to be consistent with the

the full event sample from the events measured in the crowded environment,

trigger requirement of the coincidence of at least four photomultiplier signals
favored the selection of events with a strong pile up of cosmic ray tracks and

contaminated by other tracks and had to be rejected. Monte Carlo simulations of

states is the well-known {\it Helstrom limit} presented in 1976. Since then, it
has been thought of as an intractable problem to obtain the minimum-error
probability for ambiguously discriminating arbitrary $m$ quantum states. In
this paper, we obtain a new lower bound on the minimum-error probability for
ambiguous discrimination and compare this bound with six other bounds in the
literature. Moreover, we show that the bound between ambiguous and unambiguous
discrimination does not extend to ensembles of more than two states.
Specifically, the main technical contributions are described as follows: (1) We
derive a new lower bound on the minimum-error probability for ambiguous
discrimination among arbitrary $m$ mixed quantum states with given prior
probabilities, and we present a necessary and sufficient condition to show that
this lower bound is attainable. (2) We compare this new lower bound with six
other bounds in the literature in detail, and, in some cases, this bound is
optimal. (3) It is known that if $m=2$, the optimal inconclusive probability of
unambiguous discrimination $Q_{U}$ and the minimum-error probability of
ambiguous discrimination $Q_{E}$ between arbitrary given $m$ mixed quantum
states have the relationship $Q_{U}\geq 2Q_{E}$. In this paper, we show that,
however, if $m>2$, the relationship $Q_{U}\geq 2Q_{E}$ may not hold again in
general, and there may be no supremum of $Q_{U}/Q_{E}$ for more than two
states, which may also reflect an essential difference between discrimination
for two-states and multi-states. (4) A number of examples are constructed.

DEPs of BDDs for CDCs, we first establish some fundamental geometric properties

BDDs in both subspace and injection metrics and derive analytical expressions

their distance distributions. Finally, we focus on CDCs obtained by lifting
rank metric codes and establish two important results: First, we derive

algorithm. Both the AAFT and IAAFT algorithm conserve the amplitude
distribution in real space and reproduce the power spectrum (PS) of the
original data set very accurately. The basic assumption in both algorithms is
that higher-order correlations can be wiped out using a Fourier phase
randomization procedure. In both cases, however, the randomness of the Fourier
phases is only imposed before the (first) Fourier back tranformation. Until
now, it has not been studied how the subsequent remapping and iteration steps
may affect the randomness of the phases. Using the Lorenz system as an example,
we show that both algorithms may create surrogate realizations containing
Fourier phase correlations. We present two new iterative surrogate data

clarify the role of risk and uncertainty in decision making and in particular
in relation to the phenomenon of dynamic inconsistency. By formulating this
notion in precise mathematical terms, we distinguish three types of
inconsistency: time inconsistency, planning paradox, and inconsistency
occurring in some discounting effects. While time inconsistency is well
accounted for in classical decision theory, the planning paradox is in
contradiction with classical utility theory. It finds a natural explanation in
the frame of the Quantum Decision Theory. Different types of discounting
effects are analyzed and shown to enjoy a straightforward explanation within
the suggested theory. We also introduce a general methodology based on
self-similar approximation theory for deriving the evolution equations for the
probabilities of future prospects. This provides a novel classification of
possible discount factors, which include the previously known cases
(exponential or hyperbolic discounting), but also predicts a novel class of
discount factors that decay to a strictly positive constant for very large
future time horizons. This class may be useful to deal with very long-term
discounting situations associated with intergenerational public policy choices,
encompassing issues such as global warming and nuclear waste disposal.

construct an axiom system which is sound and complete with respect to the
concrete interpretation of the language L\sharp (\Gamma) on Kripke frames. We
prove two results that solve this problem. First, let K\sharp (\Gamma) be the
logic obtained from the basic polymodal K by adding a Kozen-Park style fixpoint
axiom and a least fixpoint rule, for each fixpoint connective \sharp\_\gamma.
Provided that each indexing formula \gamma satisfies the syntactic criterion of
being untied in x, we prove this axiom system to be complete. Second,
addressing the general case, we prove the soundness and completeness of an
extension K+ (\Gamma) of K\_\sharp (\Gamma). This extension is obtained via an
effective procedure that, given an indexing formula \gamma as input, returns a
finite set of axioms and derivation rules for \sharp\_\gamma, of size bounded
by the length of \gamma. Thus the axiom system K+ (\Gamma) is finite whenever
\Gamma is finite.

separated by a thin insulating barrier layer, are currently used in spintronic
devices, such as magnetic sensors and magnetic random access memories.
Recently, driven by demonstrations of ferroelectricity at the nanoscale,
thin-film ferroelectric barriers were proposed to extend the functionality of
MTJs. Due to the sensitivity of conductance to the magnetization alignment of
the electrodes (tunnelling magnetoresistance) and the polarization orientation
in the ferroelectric barrier (tunnelling electroresistance), these multiferroic
tunnel junctions (MFTJs) may serve as four-state resistance devices. Based on
first-principles calculations we demonstrate four resistance states in
SrRuO3/BaTiO3/SrRuO3 MFTJs with asymmetric interfaces. We find that the
resistance of such a MFTJ is significantly changed when the electric
polarization of the barrier is reversed and/or when the magnetizations of the
electrodes are switched from parallel to antiparallel. These results reveal the
exciting prospects of MFTJs for application as multifunctional spintronic
devices.

spatial variations in the efficiency of photoelectric heating: photoelectric
heating rate over power absorbed by grains. We correlate the photoelectric
heating efficiency and the emission from various dust constituents and study
the variations as a function of H\alpha emission, dust temperatures, and the
total infrared luminosity. From this we estimate radiation field, gas
temperature, and electron density. We find systematic variations in
photoelectric efficiency. The highest efficiencies are found in the diffuse
medium, while the lowest coincide with bright star-forming regions (~1.4 times
lower). The [CII] line emission constitutes 1.32% of the far infrared
luminosity across the whole of the LMC. We find correlations between the [CII]
emission and ratios of the mid infrared and far infrared bands, which comprise
various dust constituents. The correlations are interpreted in light of the
spatial variations of the dust abundance and by the local environmental
conditions that affect the dust emission properties. As a function of the total
infrared surface brightness, S_{TIR}, the [CII] surface brightness can be
described as: S_{[CII]}=1.25 S_{TIR}^{0.69} [10^{-3} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}
sr^{-1}]. The [CII] emission is well-correlation with the 8 micrometer
