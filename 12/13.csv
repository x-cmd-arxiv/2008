gravitational physics on cosmological scales. The excess of power seen in the
Lyman-alpha forest and small-scale CMB experiments, the anomalously large bulk
flows seen both in peculiar velocity surveys and in kinetic SZ, and the higher
ISW cross-correlation all indicate that structure may be more evolved than
expected from LCDM. We argue that these observations find a natural explanation
in models with infinite-volume (or, at least, cosmological-size) extra
dimensions, where the graviton is a resonance with a tiny width. The
longitudinal mode of the graviton mediates an extra scalar force which speeds
up structure formation at late times, thereby accounting for the above
anomalies. The required graviton Compton wavelength is relatively small
compared to the present Hubble radius, of order 300-600 Mpc. Moreover, with
certain assumptions about the behavior of the longitudinal mode on super-Hubble
scales, our modified gravity framework can also alleviate the tension with the
low quadrupole and the peculiar vanishing of the CMB correlation function on
large angular scales, seen both in COBE and WMAP. This relies on a novel
mechanism that cancels a late-time ISW contribution against the primordial
Sachs-Wolfe amplitude.

after slow-roll inflation both in the eternal and in the non-eternal regime.
Far from the eternal regime the probability distribution for the number of
e-foldings, defined as one third of the logarithm of the volume, is sharply
peaked around the number of e-foldings of the classical inflaton trajectory. At
the transition to the eternal regime this probability is still peaked (with the
width of order one e-folding) around the average, which gets twice larger at
the transition point. As one enters the eternal regime the probability for the
volume to be finite rapidly becomes exponentially small. In addition to
developing techniques to study eternal inflation, our results allow us to
establish the quantum generalization of a recently proposed bound on the number
of e-foldings in the non-eternal regime: the probability for slow-roll
inflation to produce a finite volume larger than e^(S_dS/2), where S_dS is the
de Sitter entropy at the end of the inflationary stage, is smaller than the
uncertainty due to non-perturbative quantum gravity effects. The existence of
such a bound provides a consistency check for the idea of de Sitter
complementarity.

from reaction theory or Hartree-Fock formalism using finite-range interactions
contain a non-local part. Written in coordinate space representation, the
Schrodinger equation becomes integro-differential, which is difficult to solve,
contrary to the case of local potentials, where it is an ordinary differential
equation. A simple and powerful method has been proposed several years ago,
with the trivially equivalent potential method, where non-local potential is
replaced by an equivalent local potential, which is state-dependent and has to
be determined iteratively. Its main disadvantage, however, is the appearance of
divergences in potentials if the wave functions have nodes, which is generally
the case. We will show that divergences can be removed by a slight modification
of the trivially equivalent potential method, leading to a very simple, stable
and precise numerical technique to deal with non-local potentials. Examples
will be provided with the calculation of the Hartree-Fock potential and
associated wave functions of 16O using the finite-range N3LO realistic

of the low viscosity matter at RHIC must be in the partonic phase of the

some non-regular context-free languages while preserving the nice closure and
decidability properties of finite automata. Visibly pushdown automata with
multiple stacks have been considered recently by La Torre, Madhusudan, and
Parlato, who exploit the concept of visibility further to obtain a rich
automata class that can even express properties beyond the class of
context-free languages. At the same time, their automata are closed under
boolean operations, have a decidable emptiness and inclusion problem, and enjoy
a logical characterization in terms of a monadic second-order logic over words
with an additional nesting structure. These results require a restricted
version of visibly pushdown automata with multiple stacks whose behavior can be
split up into a fixed number of phases. In this paper, we consider 2-stack
visibly pushdown automata (i.e., visibly pushdown automata with two stacks) in
their unrestricted form. We show that they are expressively equivalent to the
existential fragment of monadic second-order logic. Furthermore, it turns out
that monadic second-order quantifier alternation forms an infinite hierarchy
wrt words with multiple nestings. Combining these results, we conclude that
2-stack visibly pushdown automata are not closed under complementation.
Finally, we discuss the expressive power of B\""{u}chi 2-stack visibly pushdown
automata running on infinite (nested) words. Extending the logic by an infinity
quantifier, we can likewise establish equivalence to existential monadic
second-order logic.

Catalog of Spectroscopic Binaries (SB9). Twins, the components of binaries with
mass ratio within 2% of 1.0, are found among the binaries with primaries of F
and G spectral type. They are most prominent among the binaries with periods
less than 43 days, a cutoff first identified by Lucy. Within the subsample of
binaries with P<43 days, the twins do not differ from the other binaries in
their distributions of periods (median P~7d), masses, or orbital
eccentricities. Combining the mass ratio distribution in the SB9 in the mass
range 0.6 to 0.85 Msun with that measured by Mazeh et al. for binaries in the
Carney-Latham high proper motion survey, we estimate that the frequency of
twins in a large sample of spectroscopic binaries is about 3%. Current
theoretical understanding indicates that accretion of high specific angular
momentum material by a protobinary tends to equalize its masses. We speculate
that the excess of twins is produced in those star forming regions where the
accretion processes were able to proceed to completion for a minority of
protobinaries. This predicts that the components of a young twin may appear to
differ in age and that, in a sample of spectroscopic binaries in a star
formation region, the twins are, on average, older than the binaries with mass
ratios much smaller than 1.

Because the clathration efficiency remains unknown in the solar nebula, we have
considered a set of sequences of ice formation in which the fraction of water
available for clathration is varied between 0 and 100 %. In all the cases
considered, we assume that the water abundance remains homogeneous whatever the
heliocentric distance in the nebula and directly derives from a gas phase of
solar composition. Planetesimals then form in the feeding zones of Jupiter and
Saturn from the agglomeration of clathrates and pure condensates in proportions
fixed by the clathration efficiency. A fraction of Kr and Xe may have been
sequestrated by the H3+ ion in the form of stable XeH3+ and KrH3+ complexes in
the solar nebula gas phase, thus implying the formation of at least partly Xe-
and Kr-impoverished planetesimals in the feeding zones of Jupiter and Saturn.
These planetesimals were subsequently accreted and vaporized into the hydrogen
envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn, thus engendering volatiles enrichments in
their atmospheres, with respect to hydrogen. Taking into account both
refractory and volatile components, and assuming plausible molecular mixing
ratios in the gas phase of the outer solar nebula, we show that it is possible
to match the observed enrichments in Jupiter and Saturn, whatever the
clathration efficiency. Our calculations predict that the O/H enrichment
decreases from 6.7 to 5.6 times solar (O/H) in the envelope of Jupiter and from
18.1 to 15.4 times solar (O/H) in the envelope of Saturn with the growing
clathration efficiency in the solar nebula.

many academics, practitioners and policy makers have studied questions related
to collapsing asset price bubbles, there is little consensus yet about their
causes and effects. This review and essay evaluates some of the hypotheses
offered to explain the market crashes that often follow asset price bubbles.
Starting from historical accounts and syntheses of past bubbles and crashes, we
put the problem in perspective with respect to the development of the efficient
market hypothesis. We then present the models based on heterogeneous agents and
the limits to arbitrage that prevent rational agents from bursting bubbles
before they inflate. Then, we explore another set of explanations of why
rational traders would be led to actually profit from and surf on bubbles, by
anticipating the behavior of noise traders or by realizing the difficulties in
synchronizing their actions. We then end by discussing a complex system
approach of social imitation leading to collective market regimes like herding
and the phenomenon of bifurcation (or phase transition) that rationalize what
crash can occur in unstable market regimes. The key insight is that diagnosing
bubbles may be feasible when taking into account the positive feedback
mechanisms that give rise to transient ""super-exponential"" price growth, the
bubbles.

the leaf tissues, this metal caused a reduction of chlorophyll a content, a
rise of guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX) activity and an increase of malondialdehyde
(MDA), soluble glucide, proline and amino acid contents. Exogenous application,
by spraying, of putrescine (Put) and spermidine (Spd) to leaf tissues reduced
CdCl2-induced stress. These polyamines proved to exert a partial, though
significant, protection of the foliar fresh weight and to alleviate the
oxidative stress generated by Cd through reductions of MDA amounts and GPOX
(E.C.1.11.1.7) activity. The enhancement of chlorophyll a content in plants by
Put and those of Chl a and Chl b by Spd both constitute evidences of their
efficacy against the Cd2+-induced loss of pigments. Conversely to Put, Spd
caused a decrease of Cd content in leave tissues and a rise in the stems and

proline stimulation observed with Cd was reduced further to the spraying of Put
onto tissues, but the decrease induced by Spd was more limited. In the plants

significantly constrains the nature of GRBs and their progenitors. We perform
population synthesis studies of the formation and evolution of early stars, and
calculate the resulting formation rates of short and long-duration GRBs at high

regardless of metallicity evolution model. These stars (having small, but
non-zero metallicity) are the most likely progenitors for both long GRBs
(collapsars) and short GRBs (NS-NS or BH-NS mergers) at this epoch. Although
the predicted intrinsic rates of long and short GRBs are similar at these high
redshifts, observational selection effects lead to higher (factor of 10)

studying the excitation of non-axisymmetric spiral density waves that are

important for affecting protoplanetary migration through the action of
associated stochastic gravitational forces and producing residual transport in
MHD inactive regions. The simulations we perform are with zero net flux and
produce mean activity levels of alpha ~ 0.005. We reveal the nature of the
mechanism responsible for the excitation of these waves by determining the time
dependent evolution of the Fourier transforms of the participating state
variables. The dominant waves are found to have no vertical structure and to be
excited during periodically repeating swings in which they change from leading
to trailing. The initial phase of the evolution of such a swing is found to be
in excellent agreement with that expected from the WKBJ theory developed in a
preceding paper by Heinemann & Papaloizou.
  We demonstrate that the important source terms causing excitation of the
waves are related to a quantity that reduces to the potential vorticity for
small perturbations from the background state with no vertical dependence. We
find that the root mean square density fluctuations associated with the waves
are positively correlated with both this quantity and the general level of
hydromagnetic turbulence. The mean angular momentum transport associated with
spiral density waves generated in our simulations is estimated to be a
significant fraction of that associated with the turbulent Reynolds stress.

the current value of a cosmological time variable, is derived from a detailed
fitting of type Ia Supernovae ""gold-silver"" data, producing Hubble plots of the
same quality of those obtained by standard cosmology, but without requiring any
dark matter or dark energy contribution.

well as infrared emission attributed to a warm debris disk. Previous studies
have developed models for the planet migration and mass growth (Alibert et al.
2006) and the replenishment of warm grains (Wyatt et al. 2007). We perform
n-body integrations in order to explore the implications of these models for:
1) the excitation of planetary eccentricity, 2) the accretion and clearing of a
putative planetesimal disk, 3) the distribution of planetesimal orbits
following migration, and 4) the implications for the origin of the IR emission.
We find that: i) It is not possible to explain the observed planetary
eccentricities (e~0.1) purely as the result of planetary perturbations during
migration unless the planetary system is nearly face-on. ii) The rate of
accretion of planetesimals onto planets in our n-body simulations is
significantly different to that assumed in the semi-analytic models, suggesting
that one cannot successfully treat planetesimal accretion in the simplified
manner of Alibert et al. (2006). iii) Eccentricity damping of planetesimals
does not act as an insurmountable obstacle to the existence of an excited
eccentric disk: All simulations result in at least 25 Earth-masses of material
remaining bound in the region ~1-9 AU, even after all three planets have
migrated through the region. iv) Gas drag works to size-sort the planetesimals,
with the largest bodies preferentially occupying the highest eccentricity and
longest-lived orbits. Further work will be required to understand whether these
eccentricity distributions are high enough to explain the level of dust
emission observed despite mass loss via steady state collisional evolution.

redshift 1.5 < z < 3, and subsequent 20-38 micron mid-IR spectroscopy confirms
that they lie in a narrow redshift window centered on z=2. We detect 9/12 of
the objects in our sample at high significance (>3 sigma) with a mean
1200\micron flux of <F_1200> = 1.6+/-0.1 mJy. Our millimetre photometry,
combined with existing far-IR photometry from the Far-IR Deep Extragalactic
Legacy (FIDEL) Survey and accurate spectroscopic redshifts, places constraints
both sides of the thermal dust peak. This allows us to estimate the dust
properties, including the far--IR luminosity, dust temperature, and dust mass.
We find that our sample is similar to other high-z and intermediate-z ULIRGs,
and local systems, but has a different dust selection function than
submillimeter-selected galaxies. Finally, we use existing 20cm radio continuum
imaging to test the far-IR/radio correlation at high redshift. We find that our
sample is consistent with the local relation, implying little evolution.
Furthermore, this suggests that our sample selection method is efficient at
identifying ultraluminous, starburst--dominated systems within a very narrow
redshift range centered at z~2.

definitive measurements of GRB polarizations. We perform Monte Carlo
simulations to derive the distribution of GRB polarizations in three emission
models; the synchrotron model with a globally ordered magnetic field (SO
model), the synchrotron model with a locally random magnetic field (SR model),
and the Compton drag model (CD model). The results show that POET, or other
polarimeters with similar capabilities, can constrain the GRB emission models
by using the statistical properties of GRB polarizations. In particular, the
ratio of the number of GRBs for which the polarization degrees can be measured
to the number of GRBs that are detected (N_m/N_d) and the distributions of the
polarization degrees (Pi) can be used as the criteria. If N_m/N_d > 30% and Pi
is clustered between 0.2 and 0.7, the SO model will be favored. If instead
N_m/N_d < 15%, then the SR or CD model will be favored. If several events with
Pi > 0.8 are observed, then the CD model will be favored.

a non-deformable `chain'. The chain consists of two straight arms, made of
touching solid spheres. In the absence of external torques, the spheres are
free to spin along the arms. The motion of the chain is evaluated by solving
the Stokes equations with the use of the multipole method. It is demonstrated
that the spinning beads speed up sedimentation by a small amount, and increase
the orientation rate significantly in comparison to the corresponding rigid

mean waves of the form: $g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+\epsilon_{\mu\nu}F(k\cdotx)$,
where $\epsilon_{\mu\nu}$ is a constant polarization tensor, and $k_\mu$ is a

$|g|-1/4\partial_\tau(|g|1/4g^{\sigma\tau})=0$ which is the conformal analog of
the harmonic gauge condition
$g^{\mu\nu}\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^\sigma=-|g|-1/2\partial_\tau(|g|1/2g^{\sigma\tau})=0,
where $\det[g_{\mu\nu}]\equivg$. Requiring additionally the conformal gauge
condition $g=-1$ surprisingly implies that the waves are both transverse and
traceless. Although the ansatz for the metric is eminently reasonable when
considering perturbative gravitational waves, we show that the metric is
reducible to the metric of Minkowski space-time via a sequence of coordinate
transformations which respect the gauge conditions, without any perturbative
approximation that \in{\mu}{\nu} be small. This implies that we have, in fact,
exact plane-wave solutions; however, they are simply coordinate/conformal
artifacts. As a consequence, they carry no energy. Our result does not imply
that conformal gravity does not have gravitational wave phenomena. A different,
more generalized ansatz for the deviation, taking into account the fourth-order
nature of the field equation, which has the form
$g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+B_{\mu\nu}(n\cdotx)G(k\cdotx)$, indeed yields waves
which carry energy and momentum [P.D. Mannheim, Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 43, 703

formation of clumps in a marginally-gravitationally unstable protoplanetary
disk, which must lose thermal energy through a combination of convection and
radiative cooling if they are to survive and contract to become giant
protoplanets. While there is good observational support for forming at least
some giant planets by disk instability, the mechanism has become theoretically
contentious, with different three dimensional radiative hydrodynamics codes
often yielding different results. Rigorous code testing is required to make
further progress. Here we present two new analytical solutions for radiative
transfer in spherical coordinates, suitable for testing the code employed in
all of the Boss disk instability calculations. The testing shows that the Boss
code radiative transfer routines do an excellent job of relaxing to and
maintaining the analytical results for the radial temperature and radiative
flux profiles for a spherical cloud with high or moderate optical depths,
including the transition from optically thick to optically thin regions. These
radial test results are independent of whether the Eddington approximation,
diffusion approximation, or flux-limited diffusion approximation routines are
employed. The Boss code does an equally excellent job of relaxing to and
maintaining the analytical results for the vertical (theta) temperature and
radiative flux profiles for a disk with a height proportional to the radial
distance. These tests strongly support the disk instability mechanism for
forming giant planets.

impurities and systematic variation of the dielectric environment to
differentiate the effects of charged impurities and short-range scatterers. The
results show that charged impurities indeed lead to a conductivity linear in
density in graphene, with a scattering magnitude that agrees quantitatively
with theoretical estimates [1]; increased dielectric screening reduces
scattering from charged impurities, but increases scattering from short-range
scatterers [2]. We evaluate the effects of the corrugations (ripples) of
graphene on SiO2 on transport by measuring the height-height correlation
function. The results show that the corrugations cannot mimic long-range
(charged impurity) scattering effects, and have too small an
amplitude-to-wavelength ratio to significantly affect the observed mobility via
short-range scattering [3, 4]. Temperature-dependent measurements show that
longitudinal acoustic phonons in graphene produce a resistivity linear in
temperature and independent of carrier density [5]; at higher temperatures,
polar optical phonons of the SiO2 substrate give rise to an activated, carrier
density-dependent resistivity [5]. Together the results paint a complete

the random set, $\Theta$, of times where the process reaches its past supremum.
Using this local time we describe an exit system for the excursions of X out of
its past supremum. Next, we define and study the ladder process (R,H)
associated to a positive self-similar Markov process X, namely a bivariate
Markov process with a scaling property whose coordinates are the right inverse
of the local time of the random set $\Theta$ and the process X sampled on the
local time scale. The process (R,H) is described in terms of a ladder process
linked to the L\'{e}vy process associated to X via Lamperti's transformation.
In the case where X never hits 0, and the upward ladder height process is not
arithmetic and has finite mean, we prove the finite-dimensional convergence of
(R,H) as the starting point of X tends to 0. Finally, we use these results to
provide an alternative proof to the weak convergence of X as the starting point
tends to 0. Our approach allows us to address two issues that remained open in
Caballero and Chaumont [Ann. Probab. 34 (2006) 1012-1034], namely, how to
remove a redundant hypothesis and how to provide a formula for the entrance law
of X in the case where the underlying L\'{e}vy process oscillates.

accretion is intermittent and on average reduced to 32% of the

We assume it comes from the three-quark state.
  There appears a resonance in the Sigma pi scattering below the N Kbar
threshold when the N Kbar channel is taken to be strongly attractive. It occurs
without introducing a BSEC, just like the chiral unitary approach. When a BSEC
is introduced, a resonance also appears with a weaker baryon-meson interaction.
The corresponding peak also has a large width, and the N Kbar scattering length
is reproduced well. The interaction whose channel dependence is the same as the
one originated from the color-magnetic interaction, where no N Kbar attraction
exists, also gives a broad peak like Lambda(1405) with help of a BSEC.
  It is found that the BSEC coupling which does not vanish at the zero momentum
transfer give a larger width. In order to reproduce the observed N Kbar
scattering length, introducing a BSEC seems preferable. In our calculation, a
model gives an appropriate value when the BSEC contribution to the resonance is
roughly half of that of the N Kbar in size.

few stellar radii from Achernar, in the thermal IR domain.
  Methods: We obtained interferometric observations on three VLTI baselines in
the N band (8-13 mic), using the MIDI instrument.
  Results: From the measured visibilities, we derive the angular extension and
flux contribution of the N band circumstellar emission in the polar direction
of Achernar. The interferometrically resolved polar envelope contributes 13.4
+/- 2.5 % of the photospheric flux in the N band, with a full width at half
maximum of 9.9 +/- 2.3 mas (~ 6 Rstar). This flux contribution is in good
agreement with the photometric IR excess of 10-20% measured by fitting the
spectral energy distribution. Due to our limited azimuth coverage, we can only
establish an upper limit of 5-10% for the equatorial envelope. We compare the
observed properties of the envelope with an existing model of this star
computed with the SIMECA code.
  Conclusions: The observed extended emission in the thermal IR along the polar
direction of Achernar is well reproduced by the existing SIMECA model. Already
detected at 2.2mic, this polar envelope is most probably an observational
signature of the fast wind ejected by the hot polar caps of the star.

stage of heavy ion collisions. Our kinetic model is based on a Wigner function
method for fermion-pair production in strong non-Abelian fields. To describe
the overlap of two colliding heavy ions we have applied the time-dependent
color field with a pulse-like shape. The calculations have been performed in an
SU(2)-color model with finite current quark masses. For strange quark-pair
production the obtained results are close to the Schwinger limit, as we
expected. For charm quark the large inverse temporal width of the field pulse,
instead of the large charm quark mass, determines the efficiency of the
quark-pair production. Thus we do not observe the expected suppression of charm
quark-pair production connecting to the usual Schwinger-formalism, but our
calculation results in a relatively large charm quark yield. This effect
appears in Abelian models as well, demonstrating that particle-pair production
for fast varying non-Abelian gluon field strongly deviates from the Schwinger
limit for charm quark. We display our results on number densities for light,
strange, charm quark-pairs, and different suppression factors as the function
of characteristic time of acting chromo-electric field.

the $K^-$ and meson mean fields. Both effects of the $\bar K-\bar K$ repulsive

$\Phi(x)=1-\varepsilon x$ for sufficiently small $\varepsilon$. We finally
perform a perturbation analysis of this latter solution for small

bounds for the total variation norm between the distribution of the number of

simulations. We then present novel estimators for the dynamical effective
charge during free solution electrophoresis and compare them to static
estimators. We find complete agreement between the static and the dynamic
estimators. We further evaluate the scaling behaviour of the effective friction
of the polyelectrolyte-counterion complex with the surrounding fluid. We
identify a hydrodynamic screening length beyond which the friction during
electrophoresis is linear depending on the chain length resulting in a constant
mobility for long polyelectrolyte chains. Our results show a convincing
agreement with experimental data and demonstrate that it is possible to model
dynamic behaviour of polyelectrolytes using coarse grained models, provided
they include the effects of hydrodynamical interactions.

links if every knot and link has a projection to the sphere such that the
number of edges of each complementary face of the projection comes from the

finite or infinite, are universal. We also consider how to minimize the number

arbitrary linear block codes and can be written as an Integer Programming (IP)
problem. Feldman et al. relaxed this IP problem and presented Linear
Programming (LP) based decoding algorithm for linear block codes. In this
paper, we propose a new IP formulation of the ML decoding problem and solve the
IP with generic methods. The formulation uses indicator variables to detect
violated parity checks. We derive Gomory cuts from our formulation and use them
in a separation algorithm to find ML codewords. We further propose an efficient
method of finding cuts induced by redundant parity checks (RPC). Under certain
circumstances we can guarantee that these RPC cuts are valid and cut off the
fractional optimal solutions of LP decoding. We demonstrate on two LDPC codes
and one BCH code that our separation algorithm performs significantly better
than LP decoding.

strategies for precision measurements of the Standard Model parameters at the
LHC. The common feature of these strategies is their robustness with respect to
the systematic measurement and modeling error sources. Their impact on the
precision of the measured parameters is reduced using dedicated observables and
dedicated measurement procedures which exploit flexibilities of the collider
and detector running modes. In the present paper we focus our attention on the
measurement of the charge asymmetry of the W-boson mass. This measurement is of
primordial importance for the LHC experimental program, both as a direct test
of the charge-sign-independent coupling of the W-bosons to the matter particles
and as a necessary first step towards the precision measurement of the
charge-averaged W-boson mass. We propose and evaluate the LHC-specific strategy
to measure the mass difference between the positively and negatively charged
W-bosons, MW+ - MW-. We show that its present precision can be improved at the
LHC by a factor of 20. We argue that such a precision is beyond the reach of
the standard measurement and calibration methods imported to the LHC from the
Tevatron program.

structure. We present new data from the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array HI
(GALFA-HI) Survey that show the full extent and detailed spatial and kinematic
structure of M33's neutral hydrogen. Over 18% of the HI mass of M33 (M_HI(tot)
=1.4 x 10^9 Msun) is found beyond the star forming disk as traced in the
far-ultraviolet (FUV). The most distinct features are extended warps, an arc
from the northern warp to the disk, diffuse gas surrounding the galaxy, and a
southern cloud with a filament back to the galaxy. The features extend out to
22 kpc from the galaxy center (18 kpc from the edge of the FUV disk) and the
gas is directly connected to M33's disk. Only five discrete clouds (i.e., gas
not directly connected to M33 in position-velocity space) are catalogued in the
vicinity of M33, and these clouds show similar properties to Galactic and M31
halo clouds. M33's gaseous features most likely originate from the tidal
disruption of M33 by M31 1-3 Gyr ago as shown from an orbit analysis which
results in a tidal radius < 15 kpc in the majority of M33's possible orbits.
M33 is now beyond the disruptive gravitational influence of M31 and the gas
appears to be returning to M33's disk and redistributing its star formation
fuel. M33's high mean velocity dispersion in the disk (~18.5 km/s) may also be
consistent with the previous interaction and high rate of star formation. M33
will either exhaust its star formation fuel in the next few Gyrs or eventually
become star formation fuel for M31. The latter represents the accretion of a
large gaseous satellite by a spiral galaxy, similar to the Magellanic Clouds'
relationship to the Galaxy.
