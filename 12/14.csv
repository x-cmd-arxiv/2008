  Walk Models","PhD thesis. 89 pages, 6 figues. LaTeX",,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  * ACTIVATED RANDOM WALK MODEL * This is a conservative particle system on the
lattice, with a Markovian continuous-time evolution. Active particles perform
random walks without interaction, and they may as well change their state to
passive, then stopping to jump. When particles of both types occupy the same
site, they all become active. This model exhibits phase transition in the sense
that for low initial densities the system locally fixates and for high
densities it keeps active. Though extensively studied in the physics
literature, the matter of giving a mathematical proof of such phase transition
remained as an open problem for several years. In this work we identify some
variables that are sufficient to characterize fixation and at the same time are
stochastically monotone in the model's parameters. We employ an explicit
graphical representation in order to obtain the monotonicity. With this method
we prove that there is a unique phase transition for the one-dimensional
finite-range random walk. Joint with V. Sidoravicius.
  * BROKEN LINE PROCESS * We introduce the broken line process and derive some
of its properties. Its discrete version is presented first and a natural
generalization to the continuum is then proposed and studied. The broken lines
are related to the Young diagram and the Hammersley process and are useful for
computing last passage percolation values and finding maximal oriented paths.
For a class of passage time distributions there is a family of boundary
conditions that make the process stationary and reversible. One application is
a simple proof of the explicit law of large numbers for last passage
percolation with exponential and geometric distributions. Joint with V.
Sidoravicius, D. Surgailis, and M. E. Vares.

  Methods: We use direct imaging to identify wide stellar and substellar
companions as co-moving objects to the observed exoplanet host stars, whose
masses and spectral types are determined with follow-up photometry and
spectroscopy.
  Results: We found two new co-moving companions of the exoplanet host stars
HD125612 and HD212301. HD125612B is a wide M4 dwarf (0.18 Msun) companion of
the exoplanet host star HD125612, located about 1.5 arcmin (~4750 AU of
projected separation) south-east of its primary. In contrast, HD212301B is a
close M3 dwarf (0.35 Msun), which is found about 4.4 arcsec (~230 AU of
projected separation) north-west of its primary.
  Conclusions: The binaries HD125612AB and HD212301AB are new members in the
continuously growing list of exoplanet host star systems of which 43 are
presently known. Hence, the multiplicity rate of exoplanet host stars is about
17%.

(supersonic) polar flows are formed above the planet surface which produce weak
shocks and outflow on the night-side. In comparison to a spherically symmetric
wind with the same parameters, the sonic surface on the day-side is much closer
to the planet surface in multidimensions, and the total mass loss rate is
reduced by almost a factor of four. We also compute the steady-state structure
of interacting planetary and stellar winds. Both winds end in a termination
shock, with a parabolic contact discontinuity which is draped over the planet
separating the two shocked winds. The planetary wind termination shock and the
sonic surface in the wind are well separated, so that the mass loss rate from
the planet is essentially unaffected. However, the confinement of the planetary
wind to the small volume bounded by the contact discontinuity greatly enhances
the column density close to the planet, which might be important for the
interpretation of observations of absorption lines formed by gas surrounding
transiting planets.

on the SU(3)c times SU(3)L times U(1)' gauge symmetry. By this extension, the
dominant source of radiative correction to the Higgs mass squared coming from
the stop loop becomes controllable based on the enhanced symmetry. Then it
becomes a viable model which provides a solution to the little hierarchy
problem in SUSY models. Even in the original scenario, the Dirac gauginos can
be superheavy, of order 10 TeV or so, while keeping the scalar masses at the
weak scale. This possibility is phenomenologically interesting because it can
suppress the unwanted flavor changing processes. And in scope of the LHC, this

unprecedented Doppler sensitivities. The addition of an on-board digital
receiver would allow the up- and down-link Doppler frequencies to be measured
separately. Such separate, high-quality measurements allow optimal data
combinations that suppress the currently-leading noise sources: phase
scintillation noise from the Earth's atmosphere and Doppler noise caused by
mechanical vibrations of the ground antenna. Here we provide a general
expression for the optimal combination of ground and on-board Doppler data and
compute the sensitivity such a system would have to low-frequency gravitational
waves (GWs). Assuming a plasma scintillation noise calibration comparable to
that already demonstrated with the multi-link CASSINI radio system, the
space-clock/digital-receiver instrumentation enhancements would give GW strain
sensitivity of $2.0 \times 10^{-17}$ for randomly polarized, monochromatic GW
signals over a two-decade ($\sim0.0001-0.01$ Hz) region of the low-frequency
band. This is about an order of magnitude better than currently achieved with
traditional two-way coherent Doppler experiments. The utility of optimally
combining simultaneous up- and down-link observations is not limited to GW
searches. The Doppler tracking technique discussed here could be performed at
minimal incremental cost to also improve other radio science experiments (i.e.
tests of relativistic gravity, planetary and satellite gravity field

continuous trajectories of particles from the source to the detector. This idea
seems to result as an unavoidable conclusion from some simple experiments. In
its original form, Hardy's thought-experiment was proposed for two independent
particles, a positron and an electron. The two either meet and annihilate, or
don't meet but become entangled. An important feature of entanglements with
particles that never meet is the difficulty they raise in front of the
assumption of ""hidden communication"" between the particles. Indeed, if the
particles don't meet, they can't have information of one another and it is
difficult to explain how can they communicate. In order to implement Hardy's
paradox with particles that never meet, the present article proposes to use
photons from three different lasers, one laser emitting UV rays, and the other
two emitting at the wavelength of the signal photon, respectively the idler
photon obtained from the down-conversion of the UV rays. The role of the
annihilation in Hardy's experiment will be played by the destructive
interference between a down-conversion pair and two photons from the low-energy
lasers.

collaborations at a spatial volume of (2.7 fm)^3 and a range of quark masses
with a lightest value corresponding to a (partially-quenched) pion mass of 275
MeV. When extrapolated to the physical values of the light quark masses, the
results of our calculations are generally in good agreement with experimental
determinations in the bottom sector. However, the static limit splittings
between the Omega_b^- baryon and other bottom hadrons tend to slightly
underestimate those obtained using the recent D-zero measurement of the

sample at 24, 60 and 170 microns. When compared with 2MASS Ks band
luminosities, lenticular (S0) galaxies exhibit a much wider range of mid to
far-infrared luminosities then elliptical (E) galaxies. Mid and far-infrared
emission from E galaxies is a combination of circumstellar or interstellar
emission from local mass-losing red giant stars, dust buoyantly transported
from the galactic cores into distant hot interstellar gas and dust accreted
from the environment. The source of mid and far-IR emission in S0 galaxies is
quite different and is consistent with low levels of star formation, 0.02 - 0.2
Msol/yr, in cold, dusty gaseous disks. The infrared 24micron-70micron color is
systematically lower for (mostly S0) galaxies with known molecular disks. Our
observations support the conjecture that cold dusty gas in some S0 galaxies is
created by stellar mass loss at approximately the same rate that it is consumed
by star formation, so the mass depletion of these disks by star formation will
be slow. Unlike E galaxies, the infrared luminosities of S0 galaxies correlate
with both the mass of molecular gas and the stellar Hbeta spectral index, and
all are related to the recent star formation rate. However, star formation
rates estimated from the Hbeta emission line luminosities L_{Hbeta} in SAURON
S0 galaxies are generally much smaller. Since L_{Hbeta} does not correlate with
24 microns emission from dust heated by young stars, optical emission lines
appear to be a poor indicator of star formation rates in SAURON S0 galaxies.
The absence of Hbeta emission may be due to a relative absence of OB stars in
the initial mass function or to dust absorption of Hbeta emission lines.

variation across the absorptive part of the H-alpha line is seen in Post-AGB
stars as well as RV-Tau, Delta-Scuti, and other types. Each of these stars
shows evidence of obscuration by intervening circumstellar hydrogen gas and the
polarization effect is in the absorptive component, consistent with an optical
pumping model. We present ESPaDOnS spectropolarimetric observations of 9
post-AGB and RV-Tau types in addition to many multi-epoch HiVIS observations of
these targets. We find significant polarization changes across the H-alpha line
in 8/9 stars with polarization amplitudes of 0.5% to over 3% (5/6 Post-AGB and
3/3 RV-Tau). In all but one of these, the polarization change is dominated by
the absorptive component of the line profile. There is no evidence that
subclasses of obscured stars showing stellar pulsations (RV-Tau for Post-AGB
stars and Delta-Scuti for Herbig Ae/Be stars) show significant
spectropolarimetric differences from the main class. Significant temporal
variability is evident from both HiVIS and ESPaDOnS data for several stars
presented here: 89 Her, AC Her, SS Lep, MWC 120, AB Aurigae and HD144668. The
morphologies and temporal variability are comparable to existing large samples

the difference between the wavenumber $k$ and the mass $\mu$ of the phantom
scalar perturbation. For $k<\mu$, the phantom scalar perturbation in the
late-time evolution grows with an exponential rate as in the four-dimensional
Schwarzschild black hole spacetime. While, for $k=\mu$, the late-time behavior
has the same form as that of the massless scalar field perturbation in the
background of a black hole. Furthermore, for $k>\mu$, the late-time evolution
of phantom scalar perturbation is dominated by a decaying tail with an
oscillation which is consistent with that of the usual massive scalar field.
Thus, the Schwarzschild black string is unstable only against the phantom
scalar perturbations which satisfy the wavelength $\lambda>2\pi/\mu$. These
information can help us know more about the wave dynamics of phantom scalar
perturbation and the properties of black string.

mean-variance analysis. Under his framework, the theoretical optimal allocation
vector can be very different from the estimated one for large portfolios due to
the intrinsic difficulty of estimating a vast covariance matrix and return
vector. This can result in adverse performance in portfolio selected based on
empirical data due to the accumulation of estimation errors. We address this
problem by introducing the gross-exposure constrained mean-variance portfolio
selection. We show that with gross-exposure constraint the theoretical optimal
portfolios have similar performance to the empirically selected ones based on
estimated covariance matrices and there is no error accumulation effect from
estimation of vast covariance matrices. This gives theoretical justification to
the empirical results in Jagannathan and Ma (2003). We also show that the
no-short-sale portfolio is not diversified enough and can be improved by
allowing some short positions. As the constraint on short sales relaxes, the
number of selected assets varies from a small number to the total number of
stocks, when tracking portfolios or selecting assets. This achieves the optimal
sparse portfolio selection, which has close performance to the theoretical
optimal one. Among 1000 stocks, for example, we are able to identify all
optimal subsets of portfolios of different sizes, their associated allocation
vectors, and their estimated risks. The utility of our new approach is
illustrated by simulation and empirical studies on the 100 Fama-French
industrial portfolios and the 400 stocks randomly selected from Russell 3000.

non-rotating black holes were studied for fully ionized, multi-component
fluids, which are described by a relativistic equation of state (EoS). We
showed that the polytropic index depends on the temperature as well as on the
composition of fluids, so the composition is important to the solutions of the
flows. We demonstrated that fluids with different composition can produce
dramatically different solutions, even if they have the same sonic point, or
they start with the same specific energy or the same temperature. Then, we
pointed that the Coulomb relaxation times can be longer than the dynamical time
in the problem considered here, and discussed the implication.

well with source-count data and the observed background spectrum. The model is
similar to that of Rowan-Robinson (2001), but with different evolution for each
of the four assumed infrared template types. The evolution is modified in two
ways; (i) the exponential factor is modified so that it tends to a constant
value at late times, (ii) the power-law factor is modified so that it tends to
zero at redshift z_f, rather than 0 as assumed by Rowan-Robinson (2001). I find
strong evidence from the 850 and 1100 mum counts, and from the infrared
background, that z_f = 4-5, with some preference for a value at the low end of
the range, implying that star-forming galaxies at z > 5 are not significant
infrared emitters, presumably due to a low opacity in dust at these early
epochs. The model involves zero or even negative evolution for starbursts and
AGN at low redshifts (<0.2), suggesting that the era of major mergers and
strong galaxy-galaxy interactions is over.

generation (SHG) measurement of the interfacial water molecules at the aqueous
solution of the following salts: NaF, NaCl, NaBr, KF, KCl, and KBr. Through
quantitative polarization analysis of the SHG data,the orientational parameter
D value and the relative surface density of the interfacial water molecules at
these aqueous solution surfaces were determined. From these results we found
that addition of each of the six salts caused increase of the thickness of the
interfacial water layer at the surfaces to a certain extent. Noticeably, both
the cations and the anions contributed to the changes, and the abilities to
increase the thickness of the interfacial water layer were in the following
order: KBr > NaBr > KCl > NaCl ~ NaF > KF. Since these changes can not be
factorized into individual anion and cation contributions, there are possible
ion pairing or association effects, especially for the NaF case. We also found
that the orientational parameter D values of the interfacial water molecules
changed to opposite directions for the aqueous solutions of the three sodium
salts versus the aqueous solutions of the three potassium salts. These findings
clearly indicated unexpected specific Na+ and K+ cation effects at the aqueous
solution surface. These effects were not anticipated from the recent molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation results, which concluded that the Na+ and K+ cations
can be treated as small non-polarizable hard ions and they are repelled from
the aqueous interfaces. These results suggest that the electrolyte aqueous

incorporating massive resonance states. A useful approximation scheme to
organize the resonance Lagrangian is provided by the large-Nc limit of QCD.
Integrating out the resonance fields, one recovers the usual chiral
perturbation theory Lagrangian with explicit values for the low-energy
constants, parameterized in terms of resonance masses and couplings. The
resonance chiral theory generates Green functions that interpolate between QCD
and chiral perturbation theory. Analyzing these Green functions, both for large
and small momenta, one gets QCD constraints on the resonance couplings and,
therefore, information on the low-energy constants governing the Goldstone
interactions.

the quality of two Pareto sets. The basic ingredient of most hypervolume
indicator based optimization algorithms is the calculation of the hypervolume
contribution of single solutions regarding a Pareto set. We show that exact
calculation of the hypervolume contribution is #P-hard while its approximation
is NP-hard. The same holds for the calculation of the minimal contribution. We
also prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a solution has the least
hypervolume contribution. Even deciding whether the contribution of a solution
is at most $(1+\eps)$ times the minimal contribution is NP-hard. This implies
that it is neither possible to efficiently find the least contributing solution
(unless $P = NP$) nor to approximate it (unless $NP = BPP$).
  Nevertheless, in the second part of the paper we present a fast approximation
algorithm for this problem. We prove that for arbitrarily given $\eps,\delta>0$
it calculates a solution with contribution at most $(1+\eps)$ times the minimal
contribution with probability at least $(1-\delta)$. Though it cannot run in
polynomial time for all instances, it performs extremely fast on various
benchmark datasets. The algorithm solves very large problem instances which are
intractable for exact algorithms (e.g., 10000 solutions in 100 dimensions)

the topological structure but also from the time evolution of the topology. In
this paper, we study the synchronous motion of coupled maps in time-varying
complex networks both analytically and numerically. The temporal variation is
rather general and formalized as being driven by a metric dynamical system.
Four network models are discussed in detail in which the interconnections
between vertices vary through time randomly. These models are 1) i.i.d.
sequences of random graphs with fixed wiring probability, 2) groups of graphs
with random switches between the individual graphs, 3) graphs with temporary
random failures of nodes, and 4) the meet-for-dinner model where the vertices
are randomly grouped. We show that the temporal variation and randomness of the
connection topology can enhance synchronizability in many cases; however, there
are also instances where they reduce synchronizability. In analytical terms,
the Hajnal diameter of the coupling matrix sequence is presented as a measure
for the synchronizability of the graph topology. In topological terms, the
decisive criterion for synchronization of coupled chaotic maps is that the
union of the time-varying graphs contains a spanning tree.

models producing inhomogeneous graphs with $n$ vertices and $\Theta(n)$ edges
whose distribution is characterized by a kernel, i.e., a symmetric measurable
function $\ka:[0,1]^2 \to [0,\infty)$. To understand these models, we should
like to know when different kernels $\ka$ give rise to `similar' graphs, and,
given a real-world network, how `similar' is it to a typical graph $G(n,\ka)$
derived from a given kernel $\ka$.
  The analogous questions for dense graphs, with $\Theta(n^2)$ edges, are
answered by recent results of Borgs, Chayes, Lov\'asz, S\'os, Szegedy and
Vesztergombi, who showed that several natural metrics on graphs are equivalent,
and moreover that any sequence of graphs converges in each metric to a graphon,
i.e., a kernel taking values in $[0,1]$.
  Possible generalizations of these results to graphs with $o(n^2)$ but
$\omega(n)$ edges are discussed in a companion paper [arXiv:0708.1919]; here we
focus only on graphs with $\Theta(n)$ edges, which turn out to be much harder
to handle. Many new phenomena occur, and there are a host of plausible metrics
to consider; many of these metrics suggest new random graph models, and vice
versa.
