maps by performing a needlet-based data analysis. We use the foreground-reduced
maps obtained by the WMAP team through the optimal combination of the W, V and
Q channels, and perform realistic non-Gaussian simulations in order to
constrain the non-linear coupling parameter $\fnl$. We apply a third-order
estimator of the needlet coefficients skewness and compute the $\chi^2$
statistics of its distribution. We obtain $-80<\fnl<120$ at 95% confidence
level, which is consistent with a Gaussian distribution and comparable to
previous constraints on the non-linear coupling. We then develop an estimator
of $\fnl$ based on the same simulations and we find consistent constraints on
primordial non-Gaussianity. We finally compute the three point correlation
function in needlet space: the constraints on $\fnl$ improve to $-50<\fnl<110$
at 95% confidence level.

subsequent star formation in nearby protogalaxies. Here we study the radiative
feedback from the first, short-lived stars using hydrodynamical simulations
with transient UV backgrounds (UVBs) and persistent Lyman-Werner backgrounds
(LWBs) of varying intensity. We extend our prior work in Mesinger et al.
(2006), by studying a more typical region whose proto-galaxies form at lower
redshifts, z~13-20, in the epoch likely preceding the bulk of reionization. We
confirm our previous results that feedback in the relic HII regions resulting
from such transient radiation, is itself transient. Feedback effects dwindle
away after ~30% of the Hubble time, and the same critical specific intensity of
J_UV~0.1 x 10^{-21} ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr separates positive and negative feedback
regimes. Additionally, we discover a second episode of eventual positive
feedback in halos which have not yet collapsed when their progenitor regions
were exposed to the transient UVB. This eventual positive feedback appears in
all runs, regardless of the strength of the UVB. However, this feedback regime
is very sensitive to the presence of Lyman-Werner radiation, and notable
effects disappear under fairly modest background intensities of J_LW>10^{-3} x
10^{-21} ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr. We conclude that UV radiative feedback in relic HII
regions, although a complicated process, seems unlikely to have a major impact
on the progress of cosmological reionization, provided that present estimates
of the lifetime and luminosity of a PopIII star are accurate. More likely is
that the build-up of the LWB ultimately governs the feedback strength until a
persistent UV background can be established. [abridged]

further constrain the masses and radii of the components in all systems. All
three DA white dwarfs have masses of Mwd~0.4-0.6Msun, in line with the
expectations from close binary evolution. The DC white dwarf in SDSS0303+0054

single white dwarfs. The majority of all eclipsing WDMS binaries contain
low-mass (<0.6Msun) secondary stars, and will eventually provide valuable
observational input for the calibration of the mass-radius relations of
low-mass main sequence stars and of white dwarfs.

spherical to a powerful aspherical pre-planetary nebula (pPNE) outflow phase
before waning into a PNe. The pPNe outflows require engine rotational energy
and a mechanism to extract this energy into collimated outflows. Just radiation
and rotation are insufficient but a symbiosis between rotation, differential
rotation and large scale magnetic fields remains promising. Present
observational evidence for magnetic fields in evolved stars is suggestive of
dynamically important magnetic fields, but both theory and observation are rife
with research opportunity. I discuss how magnetohydrodynamic outflows might
arise in pPNe and PNe and distinguish different between approaches that address
shaping vs. those that address both launch and shaping. Scenarios involving
dynamos in single stars, binary driven dynamos, or accretion engines cannot be
ruled out. One appealing paradigm involves accretion onto the primary post-AGB
white dwarf core from a low mass companion whose decaying accretion supply rate
owers first the pPNe and then the lower luminosity PNe. Determining
observational signatures of different MHD engines is a work in progress.
Accretion disk theory and large scale dynamos pose many of their own
fundamental challenges, some of which I discuss in a broader context.

responsible for localization and delocalization phenomena. $q$-Breathers --
periodic orbits in nonlinear lattices, exponentially localized in the

modes, currently found in disorder-free systems. In this paper we generalize
the concept of $q$-breathers to the case of weak disorder, taking the Discrete

retain exponential localization near the central mode, provided that disorder

specifically arranged inhomogeneities. This effect allows us to formulate an

other model arrays and experiments with miniature mechanical lattices, light

give computable upper bounds for the geometric invariants, in terms of the
exponential tangent cones to the jump loci over the complex numbers. Under
suitable hypotheses, these bounds can be expressed in terms of simpler data,
for instance, the resonance varieties associated to the cohomology ring. These
techniques yield information on the homological finiteness properties of free
abelian covers of a given space, and of normal subgroups with abelian quotients
of a given group. We illustrate our results in a variety of geometric and
topological contexts, such as toric complexes and Artin kernels, as well as
K\""ahler and quasi-K\""ahler manifolds.

properly obtained by directly solving the Schr\""{o}dinger equation in mesh of

diffuseness of the potential as that of $\beta$-stable nuclei, the energy
difference between the neutron 2p$_{3/2}$ and 1f$_{7/2}$ levels becomes very
small or the N=28 energy gap almost disappears, as the binding energies of
those levels approach zero. This suggests that the ground states of those
neutron drip line nuclei are likely to be deformed. In particular, the
spin-parity and the magnetic moment of the ground state of odd-N nuclei,

distribution in Brazil. Yearly samples available from 1978 to 2005 were studied
and evidence was found that the complementary cumulative distribution of
personal income for 99% of the economically less favorable population is well
represented by a Gompertz curve of the form $G(x)=\exp [\exp (A-Bx)]$, where
$x$ is the normalized individual income. The complementary cumulative
distribution of the remaining 1% richest part of the population is well
represented by a Pareto power law distribution $P(x)= \beta x^{-\alpha}$. This
result means that similarly to other countries, Brazil's income distribution is
characterized by a well defined two class system. The parameters $A$, $B$,
$\alpha$, $\beta$ were determined by a mixture of boundary conditions,
normalization and fitting methods for every year in the time span of this
study. Since the Gompertz curve is characteristic of growth models, its
presence here suggests that these patterns in income distribution could be a
consequence of the growth dynamics of the underlying economic system. In
addition, we found out that the percentage share of both the Gompertzian and
Paretian components relative to the total income shows an approximate cycling
pattern with periods of about 4 years and whose maximum and minimum peaks in
each component alternate at about every 2 years. This finding suggests that the
growth dynamics of Brazil's economic system might possibly follow a
Goodwin-type class model dynamics based on the application of the
Lotka-Volterra equation to economic growth and cycle.

electromagnetic (EM) field has a problem. To address that problem we introduce
a concept of wave-corpuscle to describe spinless elementary charges interacting
with the classical EM field. Every charge interacts only with the EM field and
is described by a complex valued wave function over 4-dimensional space time
continuum. A system of many charges interacting with the EM field is defined by
a local, gauge and Lorentz invariant Lagrangian with a key ingredient - a
nonlinear self-interaction term providing for a cohesive force assigned to
every charge. An ideal wave-corpuscle is an exact solution to the
Euler-Lagrange equations describing both free or accelerated motion. It carries
explicitly features of a point charge and the de Broglie wave. A system of well
separated charges moving with nonrelativistic velocities are represented
accurately as wave-corpuscles governed by the Newton motion equations for point
charges interacting with the Lorentz forces. In this regime the nonlinearities
are ""stealthy"" and don't show explicitly anywhere, but they provide for binding
forces that keep localized every individual charge.

solutions for a large class of initial data. We cover fluid flows in a nozzle
or in spherical symmetry when the origin r=0 is included. These partial
differential equations are hyperbolic, but fail to be strictly hyperbolic when
the fluid mass density vanishes and vacuum is reached. Furthermore, when
geometric effects are taken into account, the sup-norm of solutions can not be
controlled since there exist no invariant regions. To overcome these
difficulties and to establish an existence theory for solutions with
arbitrarily large amplitude, we search for solutions with finite mass and total
energy. Our strategy of proof takes advantage of the particular structure of
the Euler equations, and leads to a versatile framework covering general
compressible fluid problems. We establish first higher-integrability estimates
for the mass density and the total energy. Next, we use arguments from the
theory of compensated compactness and Young measures, extended here to
sequences of solutions with finite mass and total energy. The third ingredient
of the proof is a characterization of the unbounded support of entropy
admissible Young measures. This requires the study of singular products
involving measures and principal values.

channels with ideal feedback for which the probability of decoding error
decreases as a second-order exponent in block length for rates below capacity.
This well-known but surprising result is explained and simply derived here in
terms of a result by Elias (1956) concerning the minimum mean-square distortion
achievable in transmitting a single Gaussian random variable over multiple uses
of the same Gaussian channel. A simple modification of the Schalkwijk-Kailath
scheme is then shown to have an error probability that decreases with an
exponential order which is linearly increasing with block length. In the
infinite bandwidth limit, this scheme produces zero error probability using
bounded expected energy at all rates below capacity. A lower bound on error
probability for the finite bandwidth case is then derived in which the error
probability decreases with an exponential order which is linearly increasing in
block length at the same rate as the upper bound.

tricritical point depends on the degree of orientational order in the system;
for sufficiently large orientational order the AC transition is 3D XY-like,
while for sufficiently small orientational order, it is either tricritical or
1st order. We investigate each of the three types of AC transitions near
tricriticality and show that for each type of transition, small orientational
order implies de Vries behavior in the layer spacing, an unusually small layer
contraction. This result is consistent with, and can be understood in terms of,
the ""diffuse cone"" model of de Vries. Additionally, we show that birefringence
grows upon entry to the C phase. For a continuous transition, this growth is
more rapid the closer the transition is to tricriticality. Our model also
predicts the possibility of a nonmontonic temperature dependence of
birefringence.

methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus (VRE) is driving the development of new technologies to
investigate antibiotics and their modes of action. We report the label-free
detection of vancomycin binding to bacterial cell wall precursor analogues
(mucopeptides) on cantilever arrays, with 10 nM sensitivity and at clinically
relevant concentrations in blood serum. Differential measurements quantified
binding constants for vancomycin-sensitive and vancomycin-resistant mucopeptide
analogues. Moreover, by systematically modifying the mucopeptide density we
gain new insights into the origin of surface stress. We propose that stress is
a product of a local chemical binding factor and a geometrical factor
describing the mechanical connectivity of regions affected by local binding in
terms of a percolation process. Our findings place BioMEMS devices in a new
class of percolative systems. The percolation concept will underpin the design
of devices and coatings to significantly lower the drug detection limit and may
also impact on our understanding of antibiotic drug action in bacteria.

connected by a path avoiding the neighborhood of the third vertex. Asteroidal
triples play a central role in a classical characterization of interval graphs
by Lekkerkerker and Boland. Their result says that a chordal graph is an
interval graph if and only if it contains no asteroidal triple. In this paper,
we prove an analogous theorem for directed path graphs which are the
intersection graphs of directed paths in a directed tree. For this purpose, we
introduce the notion of a strong path. Two non-adjacent vertices are linked by
a strong path if either they have a common neighbor or they are the endpoints
of two vertex-disjoint chordless paths satisfying certain conditions. A strong
asteroidal triple is an asteroidal triple such that each pair is linked by a
strong path. We prove that a chordal graph is a directed path graph if and only
if it contains no strong asteroidal triple. We also introduce a related notion
of asteroidal quadruple, and conjecture a characterization of rooted path

lines from the surface of the neutron star. If discovered, such lines would
constrain the neutron star equation of state, providing the motivation of this
search. The spectrometer (SPI) on board the INTEGRAL satellite observed the

limits on the redshifted 2.2 MeV emission from an accreting neutron star. Our
analysis of the transparency of the neutron star surface for 2.2 MeV photons
shows that photons have a small but finite chance of leaving the atmosphere
unscattered, which diminishes the possibility of detection.

associated to $Q(x)$ is a well known function in number theory. We generalize
the construction of the Epstein zeta function to a class of function $\phi(x)$
defined in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that we call $A-$homogeneous, where $A$ is a real
aquare matrix of order $n$ having each eigenvalue in the left hal space
$\Re\lambda>0$. Such a class includes all the homogeneous polynomials (positive
outside the origin) and all the norms on $\mathbb{R}^n$ which are smooth
outside the origin. As in the classical (i.e. quadratic) case we prove that
such zeta functions are obtained from the Mellin transforms of theta function
of Jacobi type associated to the $A-$homogeneous function $\phi(x)$. We prove
that the zeta function associated to a $A-$homogeneous function $\phi(x)$ which
is positive and smooth outside the origin is an entire meromorphic function
having a unique simple pole at $s=\alpha$ the trace of the matrix $A$ with
residue given by the product of the trace $\alpha$ and the Lebesgue volume of
the unit ball associated to $\phi(x)$, that is the volume of the set $x\in\R^n$
satisfying $\phi(x)<1$. We also prove that the theta funtion associated to
$\phi(x)$ has an asymptotic expansion near the origin. We find that the
coefficients of such expansion depend on the values that the zeta function
associated to $\phi(x)$ assumes at the negative integers.

exchanging a ball randomly picked from the higher reservoir and a ball randomly

the number of balls is large. We define the entropy as the logarithm of the

suggest that the meridional circulation enhanced by an internal rotation law
close to uniform in these magnetic stars is responsible for the observed
mixing. Thus, it is not the magnetic field itself which makes the mixing, but
the strong thermal instability associated to solid body rotation. A critical
question for evolution is whether a dynamo is at work in radiative zones of
rotating stars. The Tayler-Spruit (TS) dynamo is the best candidate. We derive
some basic relations for dynamos in radiative layers. Evolutionary models with

used to infer the upper bound on the number of particle species, showing
consistency with the holographic Bekenstein-Hawking bound. This may thus serve
to fill in a large gap in entropy of any non-black hole configuration of matter

dividing each equation by the Lp-norm of its coefficients. This preconditioning
is called geometric scaling (GS). It has long been known that diagonal scaling
can be useful in improving convergence, but there is no study on the general

electron transport carriers of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Members of the
uncoupling protein family are involved in thermogenesis and determining the
functional evolution of UCP genes is important to understand the evolution of
thermo-regulation in vertebrates. RESULTS: Sequence similarity searches of
genome and scaffold data identified homologues of UCP in eutherians, teleosts
and the first squamates uncoupling proteins. Phylogenetic analysis was used to
characterize the family evolutionary history by identifying two duplications
early in vertebrate evolution and two losses in the avian lineage (excluding
duplications within a species, excluding the losses due to incompletely
sequenced taxa and excluding the losses and duplications inferred through
mismatch of species and gene trees). Estimates of synonymous and nonsynonymous
substitution rates (dN/dS) and more complex branch and site models suggest that
the duplication events were not associated with positive Darwinian selection
and that the UCP is constrained by strong purifying selection except for a
single site which has undergone positive Darwinian selection, demonstrating
that the UCP gene family must be highly conserved. CONCLUSION: We present a
phylogeny describing the evolutionary history of the UCP gene family and show
that the genes have evolved through duplications followed by purifying
selection except for a single site in the mitochondrial matrix between the 5th
and 6th alpha-helices which has undergone positive selection.

varied from a high state to a low state and back, in two other observations it
varied from a low state to respectively intermediate states. These transitions
are interpreted as eclipse ingress and egresses of a compact object in a high
mass X-ray binary system. The phase of mid eclipse is given by HJD
2453997.476+-0.006, the eclipse half angle is 30.6+-1.2 degree. Adding
XMM-Newton observations of [PMH2004] 47 in 2001 we determine the binary period
to be 1.732479+-0.000027 d. This period is also consistent with ROSAT HRI
observations of the source in 1994. No short term periodicity compatible with a
rotation period of the compact object is detected. There are indications for a
long term variability similar to that detected for Her X-1. During the high
state the spectrum of the source is hard (power law spectrum with photon index
~0.85) with an unabsorbed luminosity of 2E37 erg/cm2/s (0.2-4.5 keV). We
identify as an optical counterpart a V ~ 21.0mag star with T_eff > 19000 K,
log(g) > 2.5. CFHT optical light curves for this star show an ellipsoidal
variation with the same period as the X-ray light curve. The optical light
curve together with the X-ray eclipse can be modeled by a compact object with a
mass consistent with a neutron star or a black hole in a high mass X-ray
binary. However, the hard power law X-ray spectrum favors a neutron star as the
compact object in this second eclipsing X-ray binary in M 33. Assuming a
neutron star with a canonical mass of 1.4 M_sun and the best fit companion
temperature of 33000 K, a system inclination i = 72 degree and a companion mass

situ reduction of HAuCl4 under mild conditions. These Au nanoparticles were
subsequently employed for the growth of GaAs nanowires (NWs) by the
vapor-liquid-solid process in a gas source molecular beam epitaxy system. The
process resulted in the dense growth of GaAs NWs across the entire surface of
the single-walled nanotube (SWNT) films. The NWs, which were orientated in a
variety of angles with respect to the SWNT films, ranged in diameter between 20
to 200 nm, with heights up to 2.5 um. Transmission electron microscopy analysis
of the NW-SWNT interface indicated that NW growth was initiated upon the
surface of the nanotube composite films. Photoluminescence characterization of
a single NW specimen showed high optical quality. Rectifying asymmetric
current-voltage behavior was observed from contacted NW ensembles and
attributed to the core-shell pn-junction within the NWs. Potential applications
of such novel hybrid architectures include flexible solar cells, displays, and

Our measure which meets this `shape criterion' is computed for a few families

Enhancements in transport occur for turbulence with finite memory time either

millisecond pulsar, appears to have a large periodic modulation in its
quiescent optical emission. In order to clarify the origin of this modulation,
we obtained three time-resolved $r'$-band light curves (LCs) of the source in
five days. The LCs can be described by a sinusoid, and the long time-span
between them allows us to determine optical period P=7251.9 s and phase 0.671
at MJD 54599.0 (TDB; phase 0.0 corresponds to the ascending node of the pulsar
orbit), with uncertainties of 2.8 s and 0.008 (90 % confidence), respectively.
This periodicity is highly consistent with the X-ray orbital ephemeris. By
considering this consistency and the sinusoidal shape of the LCs, we rule out
the possibility of the modulation arising from the accretion disk. Our study
supports the previous suggestion that the X-ray pulsar becomes rotationally
powered in quiescence, with its energy output irradiating the companion star,
causing the optical modulation. While it has also been suggested that the
accretion disk would be evaporated by the pulsar, we argue that the disk exists
and gives rise to the persistent optical emission. The existence of the disk
can be verified by long-term, multi-wavelength optical monitoring of the source
in quiescence, as an increasing flux and spectral changes from the source would
be expected based on the standard disk instability model.

$\theta^*$ is a vector of unknown parameters to be estimated. The matrix
uncertainty is in the fact that $X$ is observed with additive error. For
dimensions $p$ that can be much larger than the sample size $n$, we consider
the estimation of sparse vectors $\theta^*$. Under matrix uncertainty, the
Lasso and Dantzig selector turn out to be extremely unstable in recovering the
sparsity pattern (i.e., of the set of nonzero components of $\theta^*$), even
if the noise level is very small. We suggest new estimators called matrix
uncertainty selectors (or, shortly, the MU-selectors) which are close to
$\theta^*$ in different norms and in the prediction risk if the restricted
eigenvalue assumption on $X$ is satisfied. We also show that under somewhat
stronger assumptions, these estimators recover correctly the sparsity pattern.

that has long been viewed as a useful model for addressing several conceptual

mainly in the loop quantum gravity approach. The model was defined at
Lagrangian level in terms of a su(2)-valued connection one-form $A$ coupled
through its curvature to a su(2)-valued one-form field $e$. We address here the
problem of writing a Lagrangian formulation for the Husain-Kuchar model as a
constrained BF theory motivated by the fact that spin foam models for quantum
gravity are related to action principles of the BF type. The Lagrangian action
principle for the Husain-Kuchar model reported here differs from a previous one
found by Barbero et al in that this description involves a single constrained
BF theory rather than two interacting BF theories. It is, essentially, the
Plebanski action with the condition on the trace of the Lagrange multipliers
removed. Moreover, it can be stated that the relationship between our BF-like
action and the original one for the Husain-Kuchar model is the same
relationship that exists between the Plebanski action and the self-dual
Palatini action for complex general relativity, first because the solution to
the constraint on the two-forms $\Sigma^i$ coming from the BF-like action leads
to the Husain-Kuchar action, and second because the Hamiltonian analysis of the
Husain-Kuchar model is straightforward starting from the BF-like action
principle.

extensive investigation, especially in the last decade. Unfortunately, we still
lack of a complete understanding of the properties of matter in these

phase which is characterized by the formation of a diquark condensate. We
review some of the basic concepts of color superconductivity and some of the
aspects of this phase of matter which are relevant for compact stars. Since
quarks have color, flavor as well as spin degrees of freedom many different
color superconducting phases can be realized. At asymptotic densities QCD
predicts that the color flavor locked phase is favored. At lower densities
where the QCD coupling constant is large, perturbative methods cannot be
applied and one has to rely on some effective model, eventually trying to
constrain such a model with experimental observations. The picture is
complicated by the requirement that matter in the interior of compact stars is
in weak equilibrium and neutral. These conditions and the (possible) large
value of the strange quark mass conspire to separate the Fermi momenta of
quarks with different flavors, rendering homogenous superconducting phases
unstable. One of the aims of this presentation is to introduce non-experts in
the field to some of the basic ideas of color superconductivity and to some of

-0.04, while the CP violating asymmetry in Bs -> \phi\phi is predicted to be
zero, due to the cancellation of the mixing phase with the decay phase. Recent
measurements of \beta_s in J/psi\phi, while not definitive, are much larger
than the Standard Model predictions. Measurements in the B^o and Ds+ systems of
analogous modes point toward a 5-10% contamination of S-wave K+K- under the

added advantage of not requiring an angular analysis. Rate estimates, while not

scaling $\dot {J} \sim \dot {M} \Omega R_A^2$. The key distinction is that for
a dipole field Alfv\`en radius $R_A$ is significantly smaller than for the

this stage it can acquire transverse momentum. In the second stage a prehadron
is formed which has a very small elastic cross section with the nucleons. In
the third stage the prehadron turns into a hadron. For HERMES energies,
prehadron elastic scatterings contribute little to $p_\perp$-broadening. The
acquired extra $\Delta p_\perp^2$ of hadrons can therefore be deduced entirely
from the first stage of quasi free quark propagation with quark-nucleon
collisions. We use this model to describe $\pi$-production on Ne, Kr, Xe and
compare with the most recent HERMES preliminary data.

between the distribution function and the corresponding empirical distribution
function of a stationary sequence. Next, we give some applications to dynamical
systems and causal linear processes. To prove our main result, we give a
Central Limit Theorem for ergodic stationary sequences of random variables with
values in L^1. The conditions obtained are expressed in terms of
projective-type conditions. The main tools are martingale approximations.

(ASIC), for use in conjunction with InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiodes (APDs),
for 1550 nm single-photon detection. To evaluate its performance, we first
compare its operation with that of standard quenching electronics. We then test
4 InGaAs/InP APDs using the ASIC, operating both in the free-running and gated
modes, to study more general behavior. We investigate not only the standard
parameters under different working conditions but also parameters such as
charge persistence and quenching time. We also use the multiple trapping model
to account for the afterpulsing behavior in the gated mode, and further propose
a model to take account of the afterpulsing effects in the free-running mode.
Our results clearly indicate that the performance of APDs with an on-chip
quenching circuit significantly surpasses the conventional quenching
electronics, and makes them suitable for practical applications, e.g., quantum
cryptography.

restrict ourselves to a sub-Hopf algebra $\mathcal{H}^1_{\tmop{CM}}$ containing
the nontrivial elements, namely those for which the coproduct and the antipode
are nontrivial. There are two ways to obtain explicit formulas. On one hand,
the algebra $\mathcal{H}^1_{\tmop{CM}}$ is isomorphic to the Fa\`a di Bruno
Hopf algebra of coordinates on the group of identity-tangent diffeomorphism and
computations become easy using substitution automorphisms rather than
diffeomorphisms. On the other hand, the algebra $\mathcal{H}^1_{\tmop{CM}}$ is
isomorphic to a sub-Hopf algebra of the classical shuffle Hopf algebra which
appears naturally in resummation theory, in the framework of formal and
analytic conjugacy of vector fields. Using the very simple structure of the
shuffle Hopf algebra, we derive once again explicit formulas for the coproduct
and the antipode in $\mathcal{H}^1_{\tmop{CM}}$.
