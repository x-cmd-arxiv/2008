without fine-tuning must have a radiatively-stable Higgs potential. In little
Higgs theories, radiative stability is achieved through so-called collective
symmetry breaking. In this letter, we focus on the necessary conditions for a
little Higgs to have a collective Higgs quartic coupling. In one-Higgs doublet
models, a collective quartic requires an electroweak triplet scalar. In
two-Higgs doublet models, a collective quartic requires a triplet or singlet
scalar. As a corollary of this study, we show that some little Higgs theories
have dangerous singlets, a pathology where collective symmetry breaking does
not suppress quadratically-divergent corrections to the Higgs mass.

sample of 20 galaxies are analyzed. Line-strength indices in the bar region are
measured to derive stellar mean-age and metallicity distributions along the
bars using stellar population models. We find three different types of bars
according to their metallicity and age distribution along the radius: 1) Bars
with negative metallicity gradients. They show mean young/intermediate
population (< 2 Gyr), and have amongst the lowest stellar maximum central
velocity dispersion of the sample. 2) Bars with null metallicity gradients.
These galaxies tend to have negative age gradients. 3) Bars with positive
metallicity gradients. These galaxies are predominantly those with higher
velocity dispersion and older mean population. We found no significant
correlation between the age and metallicity distribution, and bar/galaxy
parameters such as the AGN presence, size or the bar strength. From the
kinematics, we find that all the galaxies show a disk-like central component.
The results from the metallicity and age gradients indicate that most galaxies
with high central stellar velocity dispersion host bars that could have been
formed more than 3 Gyrs ago, while galaxies with lower central velocity
dispersions show a wider distribution in their population and age gradients. A
few bars show characteristics compatible with having been formed less than <2
Gy ago. These results place strong constrains to models of bar formation and
evolution. The disk-like central components also show the important role played
by bars in the secular evolution of the central structure.

motif of a variety over a countable field is 'decomposed' (in the sense of
Postnikov towers) into the twisted (co)motives of its points; this is
generalized to arbitrary Voevodsky's motives. To this end we construct a
'Gersten' weight structure for a certain triangulated category of 'comotives':
the latter is defined to contain comotives for all projective limits of smooth
varieties; the definition of a weight structure was introduced in a preceding
paper. The corresponding weight spectral sequences are essentially coniveau
one; they are $DM^{eff}_{gm}$-functorial (starting from $E_2$) and can be
computed in terms of the homotopy $t$-structure for the category $DM^-_{eff}$
(similarly to the case of smooth varieties). This extends to motives the
seminal coniveau spectral sequence computations of Bloch and Ogus. We also
obtain that the cohomology of a smooth semi-local scheme is a direct summand of
the cohomology of its generic fibre; cohomology of function fields contain
twisted cohomology of their residue fields (for all geometric valuations).
  We also develop further the general theory of weight structures for
triangulated categories (independently from the 'motivic' part of the paper).
Besides, we develop a certain theory of 'nice' pairings of triangulated
categories; this subject seems to be new.

its possible use in investigations of (Planck-scale) spacetime fuzziness, but
most work focuses on S-matrix/field-theory observables and still very little
has been established for geometric observables. We argue that it might be
useful to exploit the ""pregeometric"" formulation of spacetime noncommutativity,
which in particular describes the coordinates of the Moyal plane in terms of
the phase-space coordinates of a point particle ""living"" in a
auxiliary/fictitious spacetime ($\{x_1,x_2\}_{Moyal} \equiv
\{q,p\}_{particle}$). This leads us straightforwardly to a distance operator
for the Moyal plane, and allows us to expose some limitations of a previous
attempt to describe the ""area of a disc"" in the Moyal plane. We also observe
that from our pregeometric perspective it is rather natural to contemplate a
spacetime whose pregeometric picture is based on the phase-space coordinates
(fields) of a string. The fact that such ""stringspaces"" essentially provide
spacetime points with extendedness is relevant for the fuzziness of geometric
spacetime observables in ways that we preliminarily characterize through an
analysis of the distance observable on a two-dimensional stringspace and
through the observation that by implementing the
Amati-Ciafaloni-Veneziano/Gross-Mende uncertainty relation in the phase space
of the pregeometric string one could have stringspaces with a novel type of
fuzzy coordinates.

formalism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 096403 (2008)], which due to its numerical
properties, is ideal for simulating the dynamics of systems containing
thousands of atoms. A major drawback of traditional AIMD methods is the
necessity to enforce the orthogonalization of the wave-functions, which can
become the bottleneck for very large systems. Alternatively, one can handle the
electron-ion dynamics within the Ehrenfest scheme where no explicit
orthogonalization is necessary, however the time step is too small for
practical applications. Here we preserve the desirable properties of Ehrenfest
in a new scheme that allows for a considerable increase of the time step while
keeping the system close to the Born-Oppenheimer surface. We show that the
automatically enforced orthogonalization is of fundamental importance for large
systems because not only it improves the scaling of the approach with the
system size but it also allows for an additional very efficient parallelization
level. In this work we provide the formal details of the new method, describe
its implementation and present some applications to some test systems.
Comparisons with the widely used Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics method are
made, showing that the new approach is advantageous above a certain number of
atoms in the system. The method is not tied to a particular wave-function
representation, making it suitable for inclusion in any AIMD software package.

structure from data sampled in molecular dynamics trajectories: the graph of
cells or G, encoding the set of cells in conformational space that are visited
by the system in its thermal wandering. The information in G however, is
encoded in a great number of fragments that must be aggregated. We describe
here the algorithmic procedures 1) for aggregating the information from G into
an hypergraph allowing to enumerate the relevant cells from conformational
space, and 2) for puttting the data in a very compact format.

gravitational constant is a constant and there is no direct exchange of energy
between DE and dark matter (DM), knowledge of the expansion history suffices to
reconstruct the growth factor of linearized density perturbations in the
non-relativistic matter component on scales much smaller than the Hubble
distance. In this paper we develop a non-parametric method for extracting
information about the perturbative growth factor from data pertaining to the
luminosity or angular size distances. A comparison of the reconstructed density
contrast with observations of large scale structure and gravitational lensing
can help distinguish DE models such as the cosmological constant and
quintessence from models based on modified gravity theories as well as models
in which DE and DM are either unified, or interact directly. We show that for
current SNe data, the linear growth factor at z = 0.3 can be constrained to 5%,
and the linear growth rate to 6%. With future SNe data, such as expected from
the JDEM mission, we may be able to constrain the growth factor to 2-3% and the
growth rate to 3-4% at z = 0.3 with this unbiased, model-independent
reconstruction method. For future BAO data which would deliver measurements of
both the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter, it should be possible
to constrain the growth factor at z = 2.5 to 9%. These constraints grow tighter
with the errors on the datasets. With a large quantity of data expected in the
next few years, this method can emerge as a competitive tool for distinguishing
between different models of dark energy.

has been investigated numerous times in order to understand the early stages of
planet formation. Most notably, the IRAS mission observed the entire sky at
mid- and far-IR wavelengths, identifying the first debris disk systems, but was
unable to detect a statistically significant sample of warm debris disks due to
its limited sensitivity at 12 microns. Using Tycho-2 Spectral Catalog stars
previously shown to exhibit 8 micron mid-infrared circumstellar excesses
confirmed at 24 microns in the Spitzer GLIMPSE survey, we investigate the
frequency of mid-IR excesses among intermediate-mass (2--4 solar mass) stars in
a complete volume-limited sample. Our study of 338 stars is four times larger
than a complete sample of 12 micron sources from the IRAS Point Source Catalog.
We find that 0.3+-0.3% of intermediate-mass stars exhibit a signature of a
possible terrestrial-temperature debris disks at wavelengths of 8 microns and
greater. We also find that 1.2+-0.6% of intermediate-mass stars exhibit
evidence for circumstellar disks undergoing inner disk clearing, i.e.,
candidate transition disk systems. Using stellar lifetimes and the frequency of
transition and primordial disks within a given spectral type, we find that
pre-main-sequence disks around intermediate-mass stars dissipate in 5+-2 Myr,
consistent with other studies.

these redshifts, being 50% complete at column densities log(N_{CIV})=13.4. We
find no C IV systems in any of the four sightlines. Taking into account our
completeness, this translates into a decline in the number density of C IV
absorbers in the range 13.0 < log(N_{CIV}) < 15.0 of at least a factor 4.4 (95%
confidence) from z~2-4.5, where the number density is relatively constant. We
use our lack of detections to set limits on the slope and normalization of the
column density distribution at z=5.3-6.0. The rapid evolution of C IV at these

to ionization effects, in which case many of the metals in the z~4.5 IGM could
already be in place at z~5.3, but in a lower ionization state. The lack of weak
systems in our data, combined with the presence of strong C IV absorbers along
at least one other sightline, further suggests that there may be large-scale
variations in the enrichment and/or ionization state of the z~6 IGM, or that C

chosen in a Lagrangian formalism. The functionality of the process is

operators which form a generalized model of probability, and computations are
most commonly described as products of unitary transformations, which are the
transformations which preserve the quality of the data in a precise sense. This
naturally leads to ""unitary circuit models"", which are models of computation in
which unitary operators are expressed as a product of ""elementary"" unitary
transformations. However, unitary transformations can also be effected as a
composition of operations which are not all unitary themselves: the ""one-way
measurement model"" is one such model of quantum computation.
  In this thesis, we examine the relationship between representations of
unitary operators and decompositions of those operators in the one-way
measurement model. In particular, we consider different circumstances under
which a procedure in the one-way measurement model can be described as
simulating a unitary circuit, by considering the combinatorial structures which
are common to unitary circuits and two simple constructions of one-way based
procedures. These structures lead to a characterization of the one-way
measurement patterns which arise from these constructions, which can then be
related to efficiently testable properties of graphs. We also consider how
these characterizations provide automatic techniques for obtaining complete
measurement-based decompositions, from unitary transformations which are
specified by operator expressions bearing a formal resemblance to path
integrals. These techniques are presented as a possible means to devise new
algorithms in the one-way measurement model, independently of algorithms in the
unitary circuit model.

10 IRDCs, selected to be relatively nearby and massive. The extinction mapping
technique requires modeling the IR background intensity behind the cloud, which
is achieved by correcting for foreground emission and then interpolating from
the surrounding regions. The correction for foreground emission can be quite
large, thus restricting the utility of this technique to relatively nearby
clouds. We investigate three methods for the interpolation, finding systematic
differences at about the 10% level, which, for fiducial dust models,
corresponds to a mass surface density Sigma = 0.013 g cm^-2, above which we
conclude this extinction mapping technique attains validity. We examine the
probability distribution function of Sigma in IRDCs. From a qualitative
comparison with numerical simulations of astrophysical turbulence, many clouds
appear to have relatively narrow distributions suggesting relatively low (<5)
Mach numbers and/or dynamically strong magnetic fields. Given cloud kinematic
distances, we derive cloud masses. Rathborne, Jackson & Simon identified cores
within the clouds and measured their masses via mm dust emission. For 43 cores,
we compare these mass estimates with those derived from our extinction mapping,
finding good agreement: typically factors of <~2 difference for individual
cores and an average systematic offset of <~10% for the adopted fiducial
assumptions of each method. We find tentative evidence for a systematic
variation of these mass ratios as a function of core density, which is
consistent with models of ice mantle formation on dust grains and subsequent
grain growth by coagulation, and/or with a temperature decrease in the densest
cores.

\chi\restriction_{G_a} for \chi \in \hat{G}, is a topological isomorphism. We
also show that an infinite compact group G is connected if and only if its arc
component G_a contains a super-sequence S converging to the identity e that
generates a dense subgroup of G (equivalently, S \setminus {e} is an infinite
suitable set for G in the sense of Hofmann and Morris).

accretion rate, the effective viscosity and the effective magnetic diffusivity
of the disk-magnetosphere boundary. The accretion rate is the main parameter
which determines the location of the magnetospheric radius of the star for a
given stellar magnetic field. We introduce a classification of accreting
neutron stars as a function of the accretion rate and show the corresponding
stages obtained from our global 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and
from our axisymmetric MHD simulations. We discuss the expected variability
features in each stage of accretion, both periodic and quasi-periodic (QPOs).
We conclude that the periodicity may be suppressed at both very high and very
low accretion rates. In addition the periodicity may disappear when ordered
funnel flow accretion is replaced by disordered accretion through the
interchange instability.

studied. Quark confinement is related to an infrared divergence of the
quark-gluon vertex. In the latter various components are dynamically induced
due to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. As a result an infrared
finite running coupling in the Yang-Mills sector is derived whereas the running
coupling related to the quark-gluon vertex is infrared divergent. Based on a
truncation for the quark-gluon vertex Dyson-Schwinger equation, which respects
the analytically determined infrared behavior, numerical results for the
coupled system of the quark propagator and vertex Dyson-Schwinger equations are
presented. The resulting quark mass function as well as the vertex function
show only a very weak dependence on the current quark mass in the deep
infrared. From this we infer by an analysis of the quark-quark scattering
kernel a linearly rising quark potential with an almost mass independent string
tension in the case of broken chiral symmetry.

For $\mathcal{R}$-currents we analyze the operator product expansion. For
infinite length matter the series generated by the OPE is not Borel summable

finite length matter the OPE series is not convergent but it is Borel summable.
When a small dipole, and the string connecting the ends of the dipole, pass
through hot matter there is an induced motion of the string in the $5^{th}$

is large enough the string would normally break into several parts after

Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). Pox 36 was selected because of the
relatively low foreground gas content that makes it possible to detect
absorption-lines weak enough that unseen components should not be saturated.
Interstellar lines of HI, NI, OI, SiII, PII, ArI, and FeII are detected. Column
densities are derived directly from the observed line profiles except for HI,
whose lines are contaminated by stellar absorption. We used the TLUSTY models
to remove the stellar continuum and isolate the interstellar component. The
best fit indicates that the dominant stellar population is B0. The fit of the
interstellar HI line gives a column density of 10^{20.3\pm0.4} cm-2. Chemical
abundances were then computed from the column densities using the dominant
ionization stage in the neutral gas. Our abundances are compared to those
measured from emission-line spectra in the optical. Our results suggest that
the neutral gas of Pox 36 is metal-deficient by a factor ~7 as compared to the
ionized gas, and they agree with a metallicity of ~1/35 Z$_\odot$. Conclusions:
The abundance discontinuity between the neutral and ionized phases implies that
most of the metals released by consecutive star-formation episodes mixes with
the HI gas. The volume extent of the enrichment is so large that the
metallicity of the neutral gas increases only slightly. The star-forming
regions could be enriched only by a small fraction (~1%), but it would greatly
enhance its metallicity. Our results are compared to those of other BCDs. We
confirm the overall underabundance of metals in their neutral gas, with perhaps
only the lowest metallicity BCDs showing no discontinuity.

peculiar chemical patterns with strong abundance variations in light elements
along with constant abundances in heavy elements. These abundance anomalies can
be created in the H-burning core of a first generation of fast rotating massive
stars and the corresponding elements are convoyed to the stellar surface thanks
to rotational induced mixing. If the rotation of the stars is fast enough this
matter is ejected at low velocity through a mechanical wind at the equator. It
then pollutes the ISM from which a second generation of chemically anomalous
stars can be formed. The proportion of anomalous to normal star observed today
depends on at least two quantities : (1) the number of polluter stars; (2) the
dynamical history of the cluster which may lose during its lifetime first and
second generation stars in different proportions. Here we estimate these
proportions based on dynamical models for globular clusters. When internal
dynamical evolution and dissolution due to tidal forces are accounted for,
starting from an initial fraction of anomalous stars of 10% produces a present
day fraction of about 25%, still too small with respect to the observed 70-85%.
In case gas expulsion by supernovae is accounted for, much higher fraction is
expected to be produced. In this paper we also address the question of the
evolution of the second generation stars that are He-rich, and deduce
consequences for the age determination of globular clusters.

black hole (BH) growth require both a fuel supply and growth of the host bulge

without sustained activity. This suggests that bright quasars must be triggered
in major mergers: a large fraction of the galaxy must be converted to new bulge
mass in a dynamical time or less. Low-luminosity AGN, in contrast, require
little bulge growth and small gas supplies, and could be triggered in more
common non-merger events. This predicts a transition to merger-induced fueling
around the traditional quasar-Seyfert luminosity divide (growth of BH masses
above/below 10^7 M_sun). We compile observations to test several predictions of
such a division, including: (1) A transition to bulge-dominated hosts. (2) A
transition between 'pseudobulges' and 'classical' bulges hosting the remnant
BHs: pseudobulges are formed in secular processes and minor mergers, whereas
classical bulges are relics of major mergers. (3) An increase in the amplitude
of small-scale clustering where mergers are more efficient. (4) Different
redshift evolution, with gas-rich merger rates rising to redshifts z>2 while
secular processes are relatively constant in time. (5) An increasing prominence
of post-starburst features in more luminous systems. Our compilation of

FIR-radio correlation within normal galaxies, we use our infrared data to
create model radio maps which we compare to the observed radio images. For 6 of
our sample galaxies we find regions along their outer edges that are highly
deficient in the radio compared with our models. We believe these observations
are the signatures of ICM ram pressure. For NGC 4522 we find the radio deficit
region to lie just exterior to a region of high radio polarization and flat
radio spectral index, although the total 20 cm radio continuum in this region
does not appear strongly enhanced. These characteristics seem consistent for
other galaxies with radio polarization data in the literature. The strength of
the radio deficit is inversely correlated with the time since peak pressure as
inferred from stellar population studies and gas stripping simulations,
suggesting the strength of the radio deficit is good indicator of the strength
of the current ram pressure. We also find that galaxies having {\it local}
radio {\it deficits} appear to have {\it enhanced global} radio fluxes. Our
preferred physical picture is that the observed radio deficit regions arise
from the ICM wind sweeping away cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and the associated
magnetic field, thereby creating synchrotron tails as observed for some of our
galaxies. We propose that CR particles are also re-accelerated by ICM-driven
shocklets behind the observed radio deficit regions which in turn enhances the
remaining radio disk brightness.

perturbations of the hydrodynamic flow field exhibits characteristic
differences in cases (i) and (ii) which reflect different patterns of momentum
flux corresponding to the existence of net forces, force dipoles or force
quadrupoles. In the absence of external fields, gradients of concentration or
pressure do not generate net forces on a colloidal particle. Such gradients can
nevertheless induce relative motion between particle and fluid. We present a
generic description of surface dissipative phenomena based on the linear
response of surface fluxes driven by conjugate surface forces. In this

via surface slip that is induced by active processes on the particle surface.

mJy, and consists of SMGs, AGN, and optically faint (z_AB > 25) sources. We
find that IR luminosities derived by fitting local SEDs with 24um photometry
alone are well matched to those when additional mid-infrared spectroscopic and
longer wavelength photometric data is used for galaxies having z < 1.4 and
24um-derived IR luminosities typically > 3x10^12 L_sun. However, for galaxies
in the redshift range between 1.4 < z < 2.6, typically having 24um-derived IR
luminosities > 3x10^12 L_sun, IR luminosities are overestimated by an average
factor of ~5 when SED fitting with 24um photometry alone. This result arises
partly due to the fact that high redshift galaxies exhibit PAH EQWs that are
large compared to local galaxies of similar luminosities. Using improved
estimates for the IR luminosities of these sources, we investigate whether
their IR emission is found to be in excess relative to that expected based on
extinction corrected UV SFRs, possibly suggesting the presence of an obscured
AGN. Through a spectral decomposition of IRS spectroscopic data, we are able to
isolate the fraction of IR luminosity arising from an AGN as opposed to star
formation activity. This fraction is only ~30% of the total IR luminosity among
the entire sample, on average. Of the sources identified as having mid-infrared
excesses, half are accounted for by using proper bolometric corrections while
half show the presence of obscured AGN. We do not find evidence for evolution
in the FIR-radio correlation over this redshift range, although the SMGs have
IR/radio ratios which are, on average, ~3 times lower than the nominal value.

The first is using the Born-Infeld action of the supertubes, and the second is
via the complete supergravity solution. Even though the Born-Infeld description
is only a probe approximation, we find that it gives exactly the same essential
physics as the complete supergravity solution. Since supertubes can depend on
arbitrary functions, our analysis strengthens the evidence for the existence of
three-charge black-hole microstate geometries that depend on an infinite set of
parameters, and sets the stage for the computation of the entropy of these
backgrounds. We examine numerous other aspects of supertubes in three-charge,
three-dipole charge supergravity backgrounds, including chronology protection
during mergers, the contribution of supertubes to the charges and angular
momenta, and the enhancement of their entropy. In particular, we find that
entropy enhancement affects supertube fluctuations both along the internal and
the spacetime directions, and we prove that the charges that give the enhanced
entropy can be much larger than the asymptotic charges of the solution. We also
re-examine the embedding of five-dimensional black rings in Taub-NUT, and show
that in different coordinate patches a ring can correspond to different
four-dimensional black holes. Last, but not least, we show that all the
three-charge black hole microstate geometries constructed so far can be

anomalies of nucleosynthetic origin. The Os isotopic anomalies are correlated,
and can be explained by the variable contributions of components derived from
the s, r and p-processes of nucleosynthesis. Much of the s-process rich osmium
is released by relatively mild leaching, suggesting the existence of an easily
leachable s-process rich presolar phase, or alternatively, of a chemically
resistant r-process rich phase. The s-process composition of Os released by
mild leaching diverges slightly from that released by aggressive digestion
techniques, perhaps suggesting that the presolar phases attacked by these
differing procedures condensed in different stellar environments. The
correlation between 190Os and 188Os can be used to constrain the s-process
190Os/188Os ratio to be 1.275 pm 0.043. Such a ratio can be reproduced in a
nuclear reaction network for a MACS value for 190Os of ~200 pm 22 mbarn at 30

abundances in the Murchison meteorite. This suggests that p process rich

after cooling and of rejuvenating glasses upon heating. The key to
understanding these structures is the interplay between the activated
reconfiguration events which generate mobility and the transport of mobility.
These effects are both accounted for by combining the random first order
transition theory of activated events with mode coupling theory in an
inhomogeneous setting. The predicted modifications by mobility transport of the
time course of the aging regime are modest. In contrast, the rejuvenation
process is strongly affected through the propagation of fronts of enhanced
mobility originating from the initial reconfiguration events. The structures in
a rejuvenating glass resemble flames. An analysis along the lines of combustion
theory provides an estimate of the front propagation speed. Heterogeneous
rejuvenation naturally should occur for glasses with free surfaces. The analogy
with combustion also provides a new way of looking at the uptake of diluents by

molecules, a fact that reflects the generic impossibility of imposing a global
twisting of layered materials. We explore the consequences of this frustration
for hexagonally-ordered assemblies of chiral filaments that are {\it finite} in
lateral dimension. Specifically, we employ a continuum-elastic description of
cylindrical bundles of filaments, allowing us to consider the most general
resistance to and preference for chiral ordering of the assembly. We explore
two distinct mechanisms by which chirality at the molecular scale of the
filament frustrates the assembly into aggregates. In the first, chiral
interactions between filaments impart an overall twisting of filaments around
the central axis of the bundle. In the second, we consider filaments that are
inherently helical in structure, imparting a writhing geometry to the central
axis. For both mechanisms, we find that a thermodynamically-stable state of
dispersed bundles of {\it finite} width appears close to, but below, the point
of bulk filament condensation. The range of thermodynamic stability of
dispersed bundles is sensitive only to the elastic cost and preference for
chiral filament packing. The self-limited assembly of chiral filaments has
particular implications for a large class of biological molecules -- DNA,
filamentous proteins, viruses, bacterial flagella -- which are universally
chiral and are observed to form compact bundles under a broad range of
conditions.

a Pauli-Villars regularisation procedure. Owing to the scalar Ward identity,
irrespective of the form or Ansatz for the kernel of the gap equation, the
consistent scalar vertex at zero total momentum can automatically be obtained
and hence the consistent susceptibility. This enables calculation of the chiral
susceptibility for markedly different vertex Ansaetze. For the two cases

easily understood. The susceptibility can be used to demarcate the domain of

this to evaluate a goodness-of-fit statistic (e.g., chi^2) for Doppler

(assuming negligible planet-planet interactions). We tested multiple
implementations using single precision, double precision, pairs of single

use of compensated summation for increased precision. However, standard single
precision is not adequate for calculating the mean anomaly from the time of
observation and orbital period when evaluating the goodness-of-fit for real
planetary systems and observational data sets. Using all double precision, our
GPU code outperforms a similar code using a modern CPU by a factor of over 60.
Using mixed-precision, our GPU code provides a speed-up factor of over 600,

South 1.4 and 5 GHz VLA survey. The radio population is studied by using a
wealth of multi-wavelength information in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands.
The availability of redshifts for ~ 80% of the sources in our complete sample
allows us to derive reliable luminosity estimates for the majority of the
objects. X-ray data, including upper limits, for all our sources turn out to be
a key factor in establishing the nature of faint radio sources. Due to the
faint optical levels probed by this study, we have uncovered a population of
distant Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) systematically missing from many previous
studies of sub-millijansky radio source identifications. We find that, while
the well-known flattening of the radio number counts below 1 mJy is mostly due
to star forming galaxies, these sources and AGN make up an approximately equal
fraction of the sub-millijansky sky, contrary to some previous results. The AGN
include radio galaxies, mostly of the low-power, Fanaroff-Riley I type, and a
significant radio-quiet component, which amounts to approximately one fifth of
the total sample. The ratio of radio to optical luminosity depends more on
radio luminosity, rather than being due to optical absorption.

metabolism, can be studied with graph-based methods. To do this, one needs to
reduce the information -- lists of chemical reactions -- available in
databases. Even for the simplest type of graph representation, this reduction
can be done in several ways. We investigate different simple network
representations by testing how well they encode information about one
biologically important network structure -- network modularity (the propensity
for edges to be cluster into dense groups that are sparsely connected between
each other). To reach this goal, we design a model of reaction-systems where
network modularity can be controlled and measure how well the reduction to
simple graphs capture the modular structure of the model reaction system. We
find that the network types that best capture the modular structure of the
reaction system are substrate-product networks (where substrates are linked to
products of a reaction) and substance networks (with edges between all
substances participating in a reaction). Furthermore, we argue that the
proposed model for reaction systems with tunable clustering is a general
framework for studies of how reaction-systems are affected by modularity. To
this end, we investigate statistical properties of the model and find, among
other things, that it recreate correlations between degree and mass of the
molecules.

standard character with flux stronger at the blue edge of the profiled line.
The extension of the line grows with radius falling and inclination angle
growing. With growing inclination angle a small hump appears in the profiled

the black hole. For positive tidal charge ($b>0$) and high inclination angles
two small humps appear in the profiled lines close to the red and blue edge of

cooling calculations. We solve the induction equation numerically using a
hybrid method (spectral in angles, but a finite--differences scheme in the
radial direction), coupled to the thermal diffusion equation. We present the
first long term 2D simulations of the coupled magneto-thermal evolution of
neutron stars. This substantially improves previous works in which a very crude
approximation in at least one of the parts (thermal or magnetic diffusion) has
been adopted. Our results show that the feedback between Joule heating and
magnetic diffusion is strong, resulting in a faster dissipation of the stronger
fields during the first million years of a NS's life. As a consequence, all
neutron stars born with fields larger than a critical value (about 5 10^13 G)
reach similar field strengths (approximately 2-3 10^{13} G) at late times.
Irrespectively of the initial magnetic field strength, after $10^6$ years the
temperature becomes so low that the magnetic diffusion timescale becomes longer
than the typical ages of radio--pulsars, thus resulting in apparently no
dissipation of the field in old NS. We also confirm the strong correlation
between the magnetic field and the surface temperature of relatively young NSs
discussed in preliminary works. The effective temperature of models with strong
internal toroidal components are systematically higher than those of models
with purely poloidal fields, due to the additional energy reservoir stored in
the toroidal field that is gradually released as the field dissipates.

into account the vortex mediated mutual friction force that is expected to be
the main damping mechanism in mature neutron star cores. Working to linear
order in the rotation of the star, we consider both the fundamental f-modes and
the inertial r-modes. In the case of the (polar) f-modes, we work out an
analytic approximation of the mode which allows us to write down a closed
expression for the mutual friction damping timescale. The analytic result is in
good agreement with previous numerical results obtained using an energy
integral argument. We extend previous work by considering the full range of
permissible values for the vortex drag, e.g. the friction between each
individual vortex and the electron fluid. This leads to the first ever results
for the f-mode in the strong drag regime. Our estimates provide useful insight
into the dependence on, and relevance of, various equation of state parameters.
In the case of the (axial) r-modes, we confirm the existence of two classes of
modes. However, we demonstrate that only one of these sets remains purely axial
in more realistic neutron star models. Our analysis lays the foundation for
companion studies of the mutual friction damping of the r-modes at second order
in the slow-rotation approximation, the first time evolutions for superfluid
neutron star perturbations and also the first detailed attempt at studying the
dynamics of superfluid neutron stars with both a relative rotation between the

X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 during its outburst in 2008 to find a signature
of the donor star, constrain its radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_2), and
derive estimates on the pulsar mass. methods: Using Doppler images of the Bowen
region we find a significant (>8sigma) compact spot at a position where the
donor star is expected. If this is a signature of the donor star, we measure
K_em=248+/-20 km/s (1sigma confidence) which represents a strict lower limit to
K_2. Also, the Doppler map of He II lambda4686 shows the characteristic
signature of the accretion disk, and there is a hint of enhanced emission that
may be a result of tidal distortions in the accretion disk that are expected in
very low mass ratio interacting binaries. results: The lower-limit on K_2 leads
to a lower-limit on the mass function of f(M_1)>0.10M_sun. Applying the maximum
K-correction gives 228<K_2<322 km/s and a mass ratio of 0.051<q<0.072.
conclusions: Despite the limited S/N of the data we were able to detect a
signature of the donor star in SAX J1808.4-3658, although future observations
during a new outburst are still warranted to confirm this. If the derived K_em
is correct, the largest uncertainty in the determination of the mass of the
neutron star in SAX J1808.4-3658 using dynamical studies lies with the poorly
known inclination.

When such a situation is created, it is hoped that thermal conductivity will
show hump below Tc. Proceeding along these lines, a sample of MgB2 with a
relatively higher residual resistivity (33.3 mili-Ohm-cm)has been found to show
a hump structure below Tc. The actual electronic thermal conductivity kel of
this sample is less than that expected from the Wiedeman- Franz law by more

kel, namely those with Leff = 0.1L0 and 0.2L0. Corresponding to these two sets

been analyzed in terms of an extended Bardeen- Rickayzen- Tewordt theory. The

inequivalent (2,8,6) multiplets. 4 supersymmetry generators are manifest, while
the constraint originated by imposing the 5-th supersymmetry automatically
induces a full N=8 off-shell invariance. The resulting action coincides in the
two cases and corresponds to a conformally flat 2D target satisfying a special
geometry of rigid type. To obtain these results we developed a computational
method (for Maple 11) which does not require the notion of superfields and is
instead based on the nowadays available list of the inequivalent
representations of the 1D N-extended supersymmetry. Its application to
systematically analyze the sigma-models off-shell invariant actions for the
remaining N=5,6,7,8 (k,8,8-k) multiplets, as well as for the N>8

Recently, it has been possible to determine with an unprecedented precision
their luminosity function, that is, the number of stars per unit volume and

only sensitive to the average cooling rate, we use this property to check the
possible existence of axions, a proposed but not yet detected weakly

abundances typical of Galactic disk planetary nebulae. Moderate ADF(O++) were
found for PB8 (2.57) and NGC2867 (1.63). For NGC2867, abundances from ORLs are
higher but still consistent with Galactic disk planetary nebulae. On the
contrary, PB8 presents a very high O/H ratio from ORLs. A high C/O was obtained
from ORLs for NGC2867; this ratio is similar to C/O obtained from CELs and with
the chemical composition of the wind of the central star, indicating that there
was no further C-enrichment in the star, relative to O, after the nebular
material ejection. On the contrary, we found C/O<1 in PB8. Interestingly, we
obtain (C/O)ORLs/(C/O)CELs < 1 in PB8 and NGC2867; this added to the similarity

unprecedented precision in 158A GeV In-In collisions. A strong excess of pairs
above the known sources is observed in the whole mass region 0.2<M<2.6 GeV. The
mass spectrum for M<1 GeV is consistent with a dominant contribution from
pi+pi- -> rho -> mu+mu- annihilation. The associated rho spectral function
shows a strong broadening, but essentially no shift in mass. For M>1 GeV, the
excess is found to be prompt, not due to enhanced charm production, with
pronounced differences to Drell-Yan pairs. The slope parameter Teff associated
with the transverse momentum spectra rises with mass up to the rho, followed by
a sudden decline above. The rise for M<1 GeV is consistent with radial flow of
a hadronic emission source. The seeming absence of significant flow for M>1 GeV
and its relation to parton-hadron duality is discussed in detail, suggesting a
dominantly partonic emission source in this region. A comparison of the data to
the present status of theoretical modeling is also contained. The accumulated
empirical evidence, including also a Planck-like shape of the mass spectra at
low pT and the lack of polarization, is consistent with a global interpretation
of the excess dimuons as thermal radiation. We conclude with first results on
omega in-medium effects.

the theory of {\it non-inertial} frames in Minkowski space-time. The transition
from a non-inertial frame to another one is a gauge transformation connecting
the respective notions of instantaneous 3-space (clock synchronization
convention) and of the 3-coordinates inside them. As a particular case we get
the extension of the inertial rest-frame instant form of dynamics to the
non-inertial rest-frame one. We show that every isolated system can be
described as an external decoupled non-covariant canonical center of mass
(described by frozen Jacobi data) carrying a pole-dipole structure: the
invariant mass and an effective spin. Moreover we identify the constraints
eliminating the internal 3-center of mass inside the instantaneous 3-spaces.

Grassmann-valued electric charges plus the electro-magnetic field we obtain
both Maxwell equations and their Hamiltonian description in non-inertial

potential. We identify the coordinate-dependent relativistic inertial
potentials and we show that they have the correct Newtonian limit.

of moments, constructing mesoscopic approximations of arbitrary order of the
otherwise microscopic system. To define the necessary closure a minimum entropy
approach is utilized. While in radiative transfer, the minimum entropy closure
for moment systems up to the first-order moment is well known, higher-order
minimum entropy closures have not been implemented. This is probably due to the
fact that the closure cannot be expressed in analytical form. Our focus thus
lies in developing some general results about the minimum entropy system and in
deriving a numerical closure. By extending to higher order, among increasing
the precision, we are able to overcome difficulties that arise for the first
order minimum entropy method. Numerical experiments in a 1-dimensional domain
irradiated by two beams or with internal source show the accuracy of this
approach.
