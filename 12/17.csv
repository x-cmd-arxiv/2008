clusters, Castor et al. and Chevalier & Clegg, against observations of the well
studied Carina Nebula. The Castor et al. theory over-predicts the X-ray
luminosity in the Carina bubble by a factor of 60 and expands too rapidly, by a
factor of 4; if the correct radius and age are used, the predicted X-ray
luminosity is even larger. In contrast, the Chevalier & Clegg model
under-predicts the X-ray luminosity by a factor of 10. We modify the Castor et
al. theory to take into account lower stellar wind mass loss rates, radiation
pressure, gravity, and escape of or energy loss from the hot shocked gas. We
argue that energy is advected rather than radiated from the bubble. We
undertake a parameter study for reduced stellar mass loss rates and for various
leakage rates and are able to find viable models. The X-ray surface brightness
in Carina is highest close to the bubble wall, which is consistent with
conductive evaporation from cold clouds. The picture that emerges is one in
which the hot gas pressure is far below that found by dividing the
time-integrated wind luminosity by the bubble volume; rather, the pressure in
the hot gas is set by pressure equilibrium with the photoionized gas at T=10^4
K. It follows that the shocked stellar winds are not dynamically important in
forming the bubbles.

to large classes of rotating black hole solutions in gauged and ungauged

Kerr black holes, asserts that the quantum states in the near-horizon region of
an extremal rotating black hole are holographically dual to a two-dimensional
chiral theory whose Virasoro algebra arises as an asymptotic symmetry of the
near-horizon geometry. In fact in dimension D there are [(D-1)/2] commuting
Virasoro algebras. We consider a general canonical class of near-horizon
geometries in arbitrary dimension D, and show that in any such metric, the
[(D-1)/2] central charges each imply, via the Cardy formula, a microscopic
entropy that agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the associated
extremal black hole. In the remainder of the paper we show for most of the
known rotating black hole solutions of gauged supergravity, and for the
ungauged supergravity solutions with four charges in D=4 and three charges in
D=5, that their extremal near-horizon geometries indeed lie within the
canonical form. This establishes that in all these examples, the microscopic
entropies of the dual CFTs agree with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropies of the

to largely bypass the errors, approximately 0.02 in the median, of the

find that the auto-correlation length increases from a very low 0.4hMpc at
10^5.5 Msun to the conventional 4.5hMpc at 10^10.5 Msun. The power law fit to
the correlation function has a slope which increases from gamma approximately
1.6 at high mass to gamma approximately 2.3 at low mass. The spatial
cross-correlation of dwarf galaxies with more massive galaxies shows fairly
similar trends, with a steeper radial dependence at low mass than predicted in
numerical simulations of sub-halos within galaxy halos. To examine the issue of
missing satellites we combine the cross-correlation measurements with our
estimates of the low mass galaxy number density. We find on the average there
are 60+/-20 dwarfs in sub-halos with M(total) > 10^7 Msun for a typical Local
Group M(total)/M(stars)=30, corresponding to M/L_V approximately 100 for a
galaxy with no recent star formation. The number of dwarfs per galaxy is about
a factor of two larger than currently found for the Milky Way. Nevertheless,
the average dwarf counts are about a factor of 30 below LCDM simulation
results. The divergence from LCDM predictions is one of slope of the relation,
approximately dN/dlnM approximately -0.5 rather than the predicted -0.9, not
sudden onset at some characteristic scale. The dwarf galaxy star formation
rates span the range from passive to bursting, which suggests that there are
few completely dark halos.

of units on two-dimensional surfaces. We review here the fundamental role payed
by both the topology of the underlying surface and its detailed curvature.
Topology dictates certain broad features of the defect structure of the ground
state but curvature-driven energetics controls the detailed structured of
ordered phases. Among the surprises are the appearance in the ground state of
structures that would normally be thermal excitations and thus prohibited at
zero temperature. Examples include excess dislocations in the form of grain
boundary scars for spherical crystals above a minimal system size, dislocation
unbinding for toroidal hexatics, interstitial fractionalization in spherical
crystals and the appearance of well-separated disclinations for toroidal
crystals. Much of the analysis leads to universal predictions that do not
depend on the details of the microscopic interactions that lead to order in the
first place. These predictions are subject to test by the many experimental
soft and hard matter systems that lead to curved ordered structures such as
colloidal particles self-assembling on droplets of one liquid in a second
liquid. The defects themselves may be functionalized to create ligands with
directional bonding. Thus nano to meso scale superatoms may be designed with
specific valency for use in building supermolecules and novel bulk materials.
Parameters such as particle number, geometrical aspect ratios and anisotropy of
elastic moduli permit the tuning of the precise architecture of the superatoms
and associated supermolecules. Thus the field has tremendous potential from
both a fundamental and materials science/supramolecular chemistry viewpoint.

consistent with a dominant contribution from pi+pi- -> rho -> mu+mu-
annihilation. The associated rho spectral function shows a strong broadening,
but essentially no shift in mass. In the region M>1 GeV, the excess is found to
be prompt, not due to enhanced charm production. The inverse slope parameter
Teff associated with the transverse momentum spectra rises with mass up to the
rho, followed by a sudden decline above. While the initial rise, coupled to a
hierarchy in hadron freeze-out, points to radial flow of a hadronic decay
source, the decline above signals a transition to a low-flow source, presumably
of partonic origin. The mass spectra show the steep rise towards low masses
characteristic for Planck-like radiation. The polarization of the excess

Psc, AQ Sgr and R Scl) has been performed from the molecular HF (1-0) R9 line
at 2.3358 $\mu$m. High-resolution (R$\sim 50000$) and high signal to noise
spectra obtained with the CRIRES spectrograph and the VLT telescope or from the
NOAO archive (for TX Psc) have been used. Our abundance analysis uses the
latest generation of MARCS model atmospheres for cool carbon rich stars. Using
spectral synthesis in LTE we derive for these stars fluorine abundances that
are systematically lower by $\sim 0.8$ dex in average with respect to the sole
previous estimates by Jorissen, Smith & Lambert (1992). The possible reasons of
this discrepancy are explored. We conclude that the difference may rely on the
blending with C-bearing molecules (CN and C$_2$) that were not properly taken
into account in the former study. The new F abundances are in better agreement
with the prediction of full network stellar models of low mass AGB stars. These
models also reproduce the $s$-process elements distribution in the sampled
stars. This result, if confirmed in a larger sample of AGB stars, might
alleviate the current difficulty to explain the largest [F/O] ratios found by
Jorissen et al. In particular, it may not be necessary to search for
alternative nuclear chains affecting the production of F in AGB stars.

earlier in Cartesian simulations in periodic boxes. As we increase the size of

ratios close to unity. These structures tile the domain along the azimuthal
direction, thus resulting in very small longitudinally averaged magnetic fields
for large domain sizes. The scales of these structures are determined by the
smallest scales of the domain, which in our simulations is usually the radial

compares the throughput loss of both SU and MU MIMO on the downlink due to

for the achievable rates for both SU and MU MIMO. It is shown that SU-MIMO is
relatively robust to delayed and quantized channel information, while MU MIMO
with zero-forcing precoding loses spatial multiplexing gain with a fixed delay

normalized Doppler frequency, and the channel quantization codebook size. The
operating regions for SU and MU modes with different delays and codebook sizes

expressions for the Laplace transforms in time of the prices and sensitivities
of single barrier options in an exponential Levy model with hyper-exponential
jumps. Inversion of these single Laplace transform yields rapid, accurate
results. These results are employed to construct an approximation of the prices
and sensitivities of barrier options in exponential generalised
hyper-exponential (GHE) Levy models. The latter class includes many of the Levy
models employed in quantitative finance such as the variance gamma (VG), KoBoL,
generalised hyperbolic, and the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) models.
Convergence of the approximating prices and sensitivities is proved. To provide
a numerical illustration, this transform approach is compared with Monte Carlo
simulation in the cases that the driving process is a VG and a NIG Levy
process. Parameters are calibrated to Stoxx50E call options.

compute these radiative corrections at 1-loop in an effective field theory
framework, using the background field method and proper Schwinger-time
regularization. In order to clarify the proper treatment of the sum over
KK--modes in the effective field theory approach, we consider the same problem
in two different UV completions of Yang-Mills: string theory and lattice field
theory. In both cases, when the compactification radius $R$ is much bigger than
the scale of the UV completion ($R \gg \sqrt{\alpha'},a$), we recover a mass
renormalization that is independent of the UV scale and agrees with the one
derived in the effective field theory approach. These results support the idea
that the value of the mass corrections is, in this regime, universal for any UV
completion that respects locality and gauge invariance. The string analysis
suggests that this property holds also at higher loops. The lattice analysis
suggests that the mass of the adjoint scalars appearing in $\mathcal N=2,4$

higher-dimensional gauge invariance and the degeneracy of bosonic and fermionic
degrees of freedom.

  AGN Jets Is Explained Simply and Naturally In the Local Quasar Model","9 pages with 8 figures",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, it was argued that the log(z)-m_{v} plot of 106,000 AGN galaxies
could be interpreted as an evolutionary path followed by local AGN galaxies as
they age. It was suggested that these objects are born as quasars with a high
intrinsic redshift component that decreases with time. When the intrinsic
component is large it causes them to be pushed above the standard candle line
for brightest radio galaxies on a log(z)-m_{v} plot. In the jets of radio loud
AGN galaxies, Beta_(app) is the apparent transverse velocity of the ejected
material relative to the speed of light. In the cosmological redshift (CR)
model the Beta_(app) vs z distribution has a peculiar shape, and there have
been several attempts to explain it. In agreement with the model proposed to
explain the log(z)-m_{v} plot, it is shown here that the peculiar shape of the
Beta_(app)-z distribution in the CR model is exactly what is expected if the
sources are local but their large intrinsic redshifts are assumed to be
cosmological in the calculation of Beta_(app). This result not only supports
our previous interpretation of the log(z)-m_{v} plot, it further implies that
if a large component of the redshift is intrinsic a similar effect should be
visible when other parameters are plotted vs z. Examining this it is also found
that the results are consistent with the local model.

ingredient of this ansatz is therefore the functional form of the collapse
barrier as a function of mass M or, equivalently, of the variance sigma^2(M).
Several such barriers based on the spherical, Zel'dovich, and ellipsoidal
collapse models have been extensively discussed. Using large scale cosmological
simulations, we show that the relation between the linear overdensity and the
mass variance for regions that collapse to form halos by the present epoch
resembles expectations from dynamical models of ellipsoidal collapse. However,
we also show that using such a collapse barrier with the excursion set ansatz
predicts a halo mass function inconsistent with that measured directly in
cosmological simulations. This inconsistency demonstrates a failure of the
excursion set ansatz as a physical model for halo collapse. We discuss
implications of our results for understanding the collapse epoch for halos as a
function of mass, and avenues for improving consistency between analytical
models for the collapse epoch and the results of cosmological simulations.

find that the new method calculates the matter power spectrum with an accuracy
better than 1% for \sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5 eV at z = 0. This error scales
approximately as (\sum m_\nu)^2, making the new linear neutrino method
extremely accurate for a total neutrino mass in the range 0.05 - 0.3 eV. At z =

at higher redshifts. This new method is computationally much more efficient

with weak rotation. The main goals of this study are: (1) to examine if there
is a significant difference between the models with identical initial and
boundary conditions but in different dimensionality (2-D and 3-D), and (2) to
understand the gas dynamics in AGN. Our 3-D simulations of a non-rotating gas
show small yet noticeable non-axisymmetric small-scale features inside the
outflow. The outflow as a whole and the inflow do not seem to suffer from any
large-scale instability. In the rotating case, the non-axisymmetric features
are very prominent, especially in the outflow which consists of many cold dense
clouds entrained in a smoother hot flow. The 3-D outflow is non-axisymmetric
due to the shear and thermal instabilities. In both 2-D and 3-D simulations,
gas rotation increases the outflow thermal energy flux, but reduces the outflow
mass and kinetic energy fluxes. Rotation also leads to time variability and
fragmentation of the outflow in the radial and latitudinal directions. The
collimation of the outflow is reduced in the models with gas rotation. The time
variability in the mass and energy fluxes is reduced in the 3-D case because of
the outflow fragmentation in the azimuthal direction. The virial mass estimated

Simulation. First, by removing superfluous mergers that are artifacts of the
FOF halo finder, we find a lower merger rate compared to previous work. The
reductions are more significant at lower redshifts, lower halo masses, and
minor mergers. Our approach agrees better with predictions from the EPS model.
Second, we find that the FOF halo finder overestimates the halo mass by up to
50% for halos that are about to merge, which leads to an additional ~20%
overestimate of the merger rate. Therefore, we define halo masses by including
only gravitationally bound particles. We provide new best-fitting parameters
for a global formula to account for these improvements. In addition, we extract
the merger rate per progenitor halo, as well as per descendant halo. The former
is the quantity that is related to observed galaxy merger fractions when they
are measured via pair counting. At low mass/redshift the merger rate increases
with mass and redshift. At high mass/redshift (for halos with masses a few
times the ""knee"" of the mass function) these trends break down, and the merger
rate per progenitor halo decreases with mass and increases only moderately with
redshift. Defining the merger rate per progenitor halo also allows us to
quantify the rate at which halos are being accreted onto larger halos. We
provide an analytic formula to convert given merger rates per descendant halo
into merger rates per progenitor halo. Finally, we perform a comparison between
observed merger fractions and the fraction of halos that have undergone a major
merger during the recent dynamical friction time, and find a fair agreement,
within the large uncertainties of the observations. Our new halo merger trees
are available at http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/MillenniumMergerTrees/.

is usually achieved with an external magnetic field or by the injection of

whose ferromagnetic properties are mediated by charge carriers. Among these

to spin by intrinsic spin-orbit (SO) interactions, inducing nonequilibrium spin
polarization tunable by local electric fields. Here we show that magnetization

star. We then examine three different scenarios: one in which the material is
mixed only by convective processes, one in which thermohaline mixing is present
and a third in which both thermohaline mixing and gravitational settling are
taken in to account. The results of these runs are compared to light element
abundance measurements in CEMP stars (primarily CEMP-s stars, which are rich in
$s$-processes elements and likely to have formed by mass transfer from an AGB
star), focusing on the elements Li, F, Na and Mg. None of the elements is able
to provide a conclusive picture of the extent of mixing of accreted material.
We confirm that lithium can only be preserved if little mixing takes place. The
bulk of the sodium observations suggest that accreted material is effectively
mixed but there are also several highly Na and Mg-rich objects that can only be
explained if the accreted material is unmixed. We suggest that the available

$R$MnO$_3$ ($R$$=$ La, Pr, Nd, Tb, and Ho) are known to undergo the phase
transition from the layered A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) state to the zigzag
E-type AFM state. We consider the microscopic origin of this transition. Our
approach consists of the two parts. First, we construct an effective lattice
fermion model for the manganese 3d-bands and derive parameters of this model
from the first-principles electronic structure calculations. Then, we solve
this model in the Hartree-Fock approximation (HFA) and analyze the behavior of
interatomic magnetic interactions. We argue that the nearest-neighbor
interactions decrease with the distortion and at certain stage start to compete
with the longer range (particularly, second- and third-neighbor) AFM
interactions in the orthorhombic ab-plane, which lead to the formation of the
E-phase. The origin of these interactions is closely related to the orbital
ordering, which takes place in the distorted orthorhombic structure. The model
is able to capture the experimental trend and explain why LaMnO$_3$ develops
the A-type AFM order and why it tends to transform to the E-type AFM order in
the more distorted compounds. Nevertheless, the quantitative agreement with the
experimental data crucially depends on other factors, such as the magnetic
polarization of the oxygen sites and the correlation interactions beyond HFA.

for strongly-coupled QCD. Light-front holography allows hadronic amplitudes in

wavefunctions of hadrons in physical space-time, thus providing a relativistic
description of hadrons at the amplitude level. We identify the AdS coordinate
$z$ with an invariant light-front coordinate $\zeta$ which separates the
dynamics of quark and gluon binding from the kinematics of constituent spin and
internal orbital angular momentum. The result is a single-variable light-front
Schr\""odinger equation for QCD which determines the eigenspectrum and the
light-front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular
momentum. The mapping of electromagnetic and gravitational form factors in AdS
space to their corresponding expressions in light-front theory confirms this
correspondence. Some novel features of QCD are discussed, including the
consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates and the behavior of
the QCD coupling in the infrared. The distinction between static structure

orientation affects the ground state structure and the transition between
self-trapping and Josephson oscillation in dynamics. Three-dimensional
numerical results and an effective two-mode model demonstrate that the onset of
self-trapping of a dipolar BEC can be radically modified by the dipole
orientation. We also analyze the failure of the two-mode model in predicting
the rate of Josephson oscillations. We hope that our results can motivate
experimental work as well as future studies of self-trapping of ultracold
dipolar gases in optical lattices.

dissipation factor (Q' ~ 10^6) as that of a giant planet with convective
envelope, its orbital circularization timescale under internal tidal
dissipation is around 1 Gyr, at least two times less than the stellar age (>3
Gyr). A plausible mechanism is that the eccentricity of GJ 436b is modulated by
a planetary companion due to their mutual perturbation. Here we investigate
this possibility from the dynamical viewpoint. A general method is given to
predict the possible locations of the dynamically coupled companions, including
in nearby/distance non-resonant or mean motion resonance orbits with the first
planet. Applying the method to GJ 436 system, we find it is very unlikely that
the eccentricity of GJ 436b is maintained at the present location by a
nearby/distance companion through secular perturbation or mean motion
resonance. In fact, in all these simulated cases, GJ 436b will undergo
eccentricity damp and orbital decay, leaving the present location within the

planet companions in nearby/distance orbits, although they are not able to
maintain the eccentricity of GJ 436b.

Rb or Cs atom is polar atom with a large permanent electric dipole moment (EDM)
of the order of eao (ao is Bohr radius) as excited state of hydrogen atom. But
we can not calculate the EDM of an atom using Boltzmann constant. The mechanism
of polar atoms by which orientation polarization arises completely differs from
polar molecules. The orientation polarization of polar molecule, such as HCl or
H2O etc, is a molecule as a whole turned toward the direction of an external
field. Unlike polar molecules, the orientation polarization of polar atom, such
as K, Rb or Cs atom, is only the valence electron in the outermost shell, along
a highly elliptical orbit, turned toward the direction of the field, but the
rest of the atom does not move! The article derived the new form of Boltzmann
constant. When it was applied to orientation polarization of polar atoms, its
value k is far less than 1.38*10-23 J/K(for example, k=7.14*10-29 J/K for Cs
atom) . When it was applied to any molecule, non-polar atom or translation and
vibration of polar atom, its value k=1.38*10-23J/K. The reason is that the
nucleus moves together with the rest of the molecule or atom. (see

the the forthcoming generation of astrometri cmeasurements, it will be
necessary to take into account effects that were neglected until the present
time. Two effects concerning the orbital elements of binary stars are
considered hereafter: the former is the local perspective (LP) effect, which is
due to the variation of the distance and of the orientation of the orbital
plane during the observation time span. The latter effect is the light--travel
time (LTT), which is also related to the orientation of the orbital plane.
Taking these effects into account would allow to find the ascending nodes of
the orbits, and lead to orbital elements more accurate than when they are
ignored. It is derived from simulations that, at a distance of 5 pc, and
assuming velocities typical of Pop.I stars, the position of the right ascending
node could be derived for a few simulated unresolved binaries when the
astrometric measurements have errors around 1 microas. For the resolved brown
dwarf binary 2MASS J07464256 +2000321, it appears that ignoring the LP effect
would result in underestimating the masses of the components by 14 per cent of
the errors as soon as the astrometric errors are around 20 microas for each
measurement. However, a `degenerate LP solution', taking into account the
variation of the semi-major axis when the distance is varying, should provide
reliable masses when the measurement errors are larger than 1 or 2 microas. A
few binaries in the Gaia program could deserve a degenerate LP solution,
whereas a the complete LP+LTT solution could be justified for resolved binaries
observed with SIM.

galaxies with M_*>10^{10} M_0 at z<1.2. We examine the structural CAS
parameters of these galaxies, deriving merger fractions, at 0.2<z<1.2, based on
the asymmetry and clumpiness values of these systems. We find that the merger
fraction between z=0.2 and z=1.2 increases from roughly f_m=0.04+/-0.01 to
f_m=0.13+/-0.01. We explore several fitting formalisms for parameterising the
merger fraction, and compare our results to other structural studies and pair
methods within the DEEP2, VVDS, and COSMOS fields. We also re-examine our
method for selecting mergers, and the inherent error budget and systematics
associated with identifying mergers using structure. For galaxies selected by
M_*>10^{10} M_0, the merger fraction can be parameterised by f_m = f_0*(1+z)^m
with the power-law slope m=2.3+/-0.4. By using the best available z = 0 prior
the slope increases to m=3.8+/-0.2, showing how critical the measurement of
local merger properties are for deriving the evolution of the merger fraction.
We furthermore show that the merger fraction derived through structure is
roughly a factor of 3-6 higher than pair fractions. Based on the latest
cosmological simulations of mergers we show that this ratio is predicted, and
that both methods are likely tracing the merger fraction and rate properly. We
calculate, utilising merger time scales from simulations, and previously
published merger fractions that the merger rate of galaxies with M_*>10^{10}
M_0 increases linearly between z = 0.7 and z = 3, and that a typical
M_*>10^{10} M_0 galaxy undergoes between 1-2 major mergers at z<1.2.

earlier simulations it was observed that the difference between the solutions
of JIMWLK and BK is unusually small for a quark dipole scattering amplitude, of
the order of 0.1%, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the naively
expected 1/N_c^2 or 11%. In this paper we argue that this smallness is not
accidental. We show that saturation effects and correlator coincidence limits
fixed by group theory constraints conspire with the particular structure of the
dipole kernel to suppress subleading-N_c corrections reducing the difference
between the solutions of JIMWLK and BK to 0.1%. We solve the JIMWLK equation
with improved numerical accuracy and verify that the remaining 1/N_c
corrections, while small, still manage to slow down the rapidity-dependence of
JIMWLK evolution compared to that of BK. We demonstrate that a truncation of
JIMWLK evolution in the form of a minimal Gaussian generalization of the BK
equation captures some of the remaining 1/N_c contributions leading to an even
better agreement with JIMWLK evolution. As the 1/N_c corrections to BK include
multi-reggeon exchanges one may conclude that the net effect of multi-reggeon
exchanges on the dipole amplitude is rather small.

key probe of confinement scenarios in Yang-Mills theories. However,
finite-volume effects become an important issue as the infrared limit is
approached. By considering general quantities -- namely an associated
susceptibility in the gluon case and properties of the lowest-lying eigenmode
of the Faddeev-Popov matrix in the ghost case -- one can derive rigorous upper
and lower bounds for the propagators. The bounds allow a better control over
the extrapolation of lattice results to the infinite-volume limit. In the case
of the gluon propagator, an intuitive statistical argument suggests a precise
volume dependence for the bounds. This dependence is nicely confirmed by the
lattice data, leading to a finite gluon propagator at zero momentum. At the
same time, an enhancement of the ghost propagator in the infrared limit seems
unlikely. Our analysis is applied to the case of Landau gauge and SU(2) gauge

dispersions, stellar ages and metallicities out to 1--2 half-light radii by
re-analysing already published long-slit and integral-field spectroscopic
datasets using the {\sc NBursts} full spectral fitting technique. Surprisingly,
bright representatives of the dE/dS0 class ($M_B = -18.0 ... -16.0$ mag) look
very similar to intermediate-mass and giant lenticulars and ellipticals: (1)
their nuclear regions often harbour young metal-rich stellar populations always
associated with the drops in the velocity dispersion profiles; (2) metallicity
gradients in the main discs/spheroids vary significantly from nearly flat
profiles to -0.9 dex $r_e^{-1}$, i.e. somewhat 3 times steeper than for typical
bulges; (3) kinematically decoupled cores were discovered in 4 galaxies,
including two with very little, if any, large scale rotation. These results

Sonine approximation for impurity particles lighter than the surrounding gas

body axis into morphological somites is controlled by an oscillating
multicellular genetic network termed the segmentation clock. This clock
operates in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), generating dynamic stripe patterns
of oscillatory gene-expression across the field of PSM cells. How these spatial
patterns, the clock's collective period, and the underlying cellular-level
interactions are related is not understood. A theory encompassing temporal and
spatial domains of local and collective aspects of the system is essential to
tackle these questions. Our delayed coupling theory achieves this by
representing the PSM as an array of phase oscillators, combining four key
elements: a frequency profile of oscillators slowing across the PSM; coupling
between neighboring oscillators; delay in coupling; and a moving boundary
describing embryonic axis elongation. This theory predicts that the
segmentation clock's collective period depends on delayed coupling. We derive
an expression for pattern wavelength across the PSM and show how this can be
used to fit dynamic wildtype gene-expression patterns, revealing the
quantitative values of parameters controlling spatial and temporal organization
of the oscillators in the system. Our theory can be used to analyze
experimental perturbations, thereby identifying roles of genes involved in

afterglows hours or days after the prompt gamma-ray emission. Nowadays with the
launch of the Swift satellite, gamma-ray bursts can be observed in

simple formulation of the shocks and emission processes used up to now. But
""devil is in details"" and some of these features may be explained with a more
detailed formulation of phenomena and without adhoc addition of new processes.

two phenomenological models for the evolution of the emitting region during the
collision. One of these models is more suitable for the internal shocks and the
other for the external collisions. We calculate radiation flux, lags, and
hardness ratios. One of our aims has been a formulation enough complex to
include the essential processes, but enough simple such that the data can be
directly compared with the theory to extract the value and evolution of
physical quantities. To accomplish this goal, we also suggest a procedure for
extracting parameters of the model from data. In a following paper we
numerically calculate the evolution of some simulated models and compare their
features with the properties of the observed gamma-ray bursts.(abbreviated)

the two phenomenological models we have suggested in Paper I for the evolution
of the {\it active region}, the synchrotron emitting region in a shock. The
dynamical active region model seems to reproduce the observed characteristics
of prompt emissions and late afterglow better than the quasi-steady model which
is more suitable for the onset of afterglows. Therefore these simulations
confirm the arguments presented in Paper I about the behaviour of these models

process $\{X_{i}\}$ is observed at the encoder, and is supposed to be
reproduced at two decoders, where $\{Y_{i}\}$ and $\{Z_{i}\}$ are observed, in
either a causal or non-causal manner. The communication between the encoder and
the decoders is carried in two successive stages. In the first stage, the
transmission is available to both decoders and the source is reconstructed
according to the received bit-stream and the individual side information (SI).
In the second stage, additional information is sent to both decoders and the
source reconstructions are refined according to the transmissions at both
stages and the available SI. It is desired to find the necessary and sufficient
conditions on the communication rates between the encoder and decoders, so that
the distortions incurred (at each stage) will not exceed given thresholds. For
the case of non-degraded causal SI at the decoders, an exact single-letter
characterization of the achievable region is derived for the case of pure
source-coding. Then, for the case of communication carried over independent
DMS's with random states known causally/non-causally at the encoder and with
causal SI about the source at the decoders, a single-letter characterization of

separation theorem holds. Finally, for non-causal degraded SI, inner and outer
bounds to the achievable rate-distortion region are derived. These bounds are
shown to be tight for certain cases of reconstruction requirements at the
decoders, thereby shading some light on the problem of successive refinement
with non-degraded SI at the decoders.

different XRBs follow different anti-correlations between $\Gamma$ and $\xi$
when $\xi$ is less than a critical value, while they follow the same positive
correlation when $\xi$ is larger than the critical value. This anti-correlation
and positive correlation are also found in LLAGNs and QSOs respectively, and
the anti-correlation and positive correlation of different XRBs roughly
converge to the same point ($\log \xi=-2.1, \Gamma=1.5$), which may correspond
to the accretion mode transition, since that the anti-correlation and positive
correlation are consistent with the prediction of ADAFs and standard
disk/corona system respectively. The traditional low/hard state are divided
into two parts by the cross point $\log \xi\sim-2.1$, i.e., faint-hard state in
the anti-correlation part and bright-hard state in the positive correlation
part. The accretion process in the bright-hard state may be still the standard
accretion disk as that in the high/soft state, which is consistent with that
both the cold disk component and broad Fe K emission line are observed in some
bright-hard state of XRBs. The ADAF is only important in the faint-hard state
XRBs. Motivated by the similarities of the state transition and timing
properties of the ULXs to that of XRBs, we then constrain the BH masses for
seven luminous ULXs assuming that their X-ray spectral evolution is similar to
that of XRBs. We find that the BH masses of these seven ULXs are around
$10^{4}M_sun$, which are typical intermediate mass BHs (IMBHs). Our results are
roughly consistent with the BH masses constrained from the model fitting with a

e*(f,T) in coarse-grain ceramics exhibits relaxor behavior at high temperatures
and a sharp anomaly at the ferroelectric phase transition. The fine-grain
ceramics exhibit mainly relaxor ferroelectric behavior with a smaller
dielectric constant. The difference is explained by different relaxational
dynamics of polar nanoclusters, which appear to be more stabilized at high
temperatures in the fine-grain ceramics by pinning at grain boundaries. Below
Tc, the growth of ferroelectric domains is suppressed in fine-grain ceramics as
supported also by a second harmonic generation. On the other hand, polar phonon
frequencies and their temperature dependences are almost independent of the
grain size, but the selection rules for the cubic symmetry are not obeyed and
all phonons are split due to a locally broken symmetry by polar nanoregions and
chemical disorder. The lowest-frequency polar phonon undergoes partial
softening down to ~ 0.1 THz near Tc = 440 K in both ceramics, but the
dielectric anomaly is caused predominantly by flipping and breathing of polar
nanoclusters. Due to contribution of both the soft phonon mode and dielectric
relaxations into the dielectric constant, the ferroelectric phase transition,
which corresponds to the percolation threshold of the polar nanoregions into
macroscopic domains, can be considered as a special case of crossover between
the displacive and order-disorder type.

investigated dielectric response of Sr_(9-x)PbxCe2Ti12O36 ceramics (x = 0-9)
between 100 Hz and 100 THz at temperatures from 10 to 700 K using low- and

revealed that Sr9Ce2Ti12O36 is an incipient ferroelectric with the R-3c
trigonal structure whose relative permittivity e' increases from 167 at 300 K
and saturates near 240 below 30 K. The subsequent substitution of Sr by Pb
enhances e' to several thousands and induces a ferroelectric phase transition
to monoclinic Cc phase for x>=3. Its critical temperature Tc linearly depends
on the Pb concentration and reaches 550 K for x=9. The phase transition is of
displacive type. The soft mode frequency follows the Barrett formula in samples
with x<=2 (typical for quantum paraelectrics) and the Cochran formula for x>=3.
The MW dispersion is lacking and quality factor Q is high in samples with low
Pb concentration, although the permittivity is very high in some cases.
However, due to the lattice softening, the temperature coefficient of the
permittivity is rather high. The best MW quality factor was observed for x=1:
Q*f=5800 GHz and e'=250. Concluding, the dielectric properties of Sr_(9-
x)PbxCe2Ti12O36 are similar to those of Ba_(1-x)SrxTiO3 so that this system can
be presumably used as an alternative for MW devices or capacitors.

variants that are competing to become the single, shared convention within an

distinguished by the way agents handle variability in the language (i.e.,
multiple forms for the same meaning). The class of models includes as special
cases two previously-studied models of language dynamics, the Naming Game, in
which agents tend to standardise on variants they have encountered most
frequently, and the Utterance Selection Model, in which agents tend to preserve
variability by uniform sampling of a pool of utterances. We reduce the full
complexities of the dynamics to a single-coordinate stochastic model which
allows the probability and time taken for speakers to reach consensus on a
single variant to be calculated for large communities. This analysis suggests
that in the broad class of models considered, consensus is formed in one of
three generic ways, according to whether agents tend to eliminate, accentuate
or sample neutrally the variability in the language. These different regimes
are observed in simulations of the full dynamics, and for which the simplified
model in some cases makes good quantitative predictions. We use these results,
along with comparisons with related models, to conjecture the likely behaviour
of more general models, and further make use of empirical data to argue that in
reality, biases away from neutral sampling behaviour are likely to be small.

families of vector fields, and used this result to construct the formal
solution of the Cauchy problem for a class of integrable nonlinear partial
differential equations connected with the commutation of multidimensional
vector fields, like the heavenly equation of Plebanski, the dispersionless
Kadomtsev - Petviashvili (dKP) equation and the two-dimensional dispersionless
Toda (2ddT) equation, as well as with the commutation of one dimensional vector
fields, like the Pavlov equation. We also showed that the associated
Riemann-Hilbert inverse problems are powerfull tools to establish if the
solutions of the Cauchy problem break at finite time,to construct their
longtime behaviour and characterize classes of implicit solutions. In this
paper, using the above theory, we concentrate on the heavenly and Pavlov
equations, i) establishing that their localized solutions evolve without
breaking, unlike the cases of dKP and 2ddT; ii) constructing the longtime
behaviour of the solutions of their Cauchy problems; iii) characterizing a
distinguished class of implicit solutions of the heavenly equation.

thermal QCD by taking into account explicitly the confining influence of the
Gribov horizon. In order to make clear the possible value of such an approach,
we briefly review the most important arguments why a straightforward
perturbative description of finite-temperature QCD is unlikely to be
successful. From the infrared problems of thermal perturbation theory one can
conclude that confinement effects and bound states probably play an important
role also in the high-temperature phase.
  To set the stage we recount the supposed role of the Gribov horizon for
confinement, before we turn to the application to finite-temperature theory. In
the current approach it has been found that the contributions to the free
energy from the explicit inclusion of the horizon begin to set in at order
$g^6$ -- precisely where the infrared problems of thermal QCD lead to a
breakdown of ordinary perturbation theory.
  From the study of observables (free energy, anomaly, bulk viscosity) we also
note that for thermodynamic observables the leading order term obtained by such
an expansion in the coupling strongly deviates from the more complete numerical
solution. This can be regarded as yet another sign for general problems of
series expansions in thermal QCD.
