in detecting high, and very high, redshift galaxies. Even though samples are
growing at redshifts z = 3 - 6, the nature of these galaxies is still poorly
known. Aims: To study the properties of z = 2.25 LAEs and compare those with
the properties of z > 3 LAEs. Methods: We present narrow-band imaging made with
the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope with the WFI detector. We have made a selection for
emission-line objects and find 170 candidate typical LAEs and 17 candidates
which we regard as high UV-transmission LAEs. We have derived the magnitudes of
these objects in 8 bands from u* to Ks, and studied if they have X-ray and/or
radio counterparts. Results: We show that there has been significant evolution
in the properties of LAEs between redshift z ~ 3 and z = 2.25. The spread in
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the lower redshift is larger and we
detect a significant AGN contribution in the sample. The distribution of the
equivalent widths is narrower than at z ~ 3, with only a few candidates with
rest-frame equivalent width above the predicted limit of 240 A. The star
formation rates derived from the Ly-alpha emission compared to that derived
from the UV emission are lower by on average a factor of ~ 1.8, indicating a
large absorption of dust. Conclusion: LAEs at redshift z = 2.25 may be more
evolved than LAEs at higher redshift. The red SEDs imply more massive, older
and/or more dusty galaxies at lower redshift than observed at higher redshifts.
The decrease in equivalent widths and star formation rates indicate more
quiescent galaxies, with in general less star formation than in higher redshift
galaxies. At z = 2.25, AGN appear to be more abundant and also to contribute
more to the LAE population. [Abridged]

GUTs and cosmology. Despite the fact that the parameter range for F-theory GUT
models is very narrow, we find that F-theory GUTs beautifully satisfy most
cosmological constraints without any further restrictions. The viability of the
scenario hinges on the interplay between various components of the axion
supermultiplet, which in F-theory GUTs is also responsible for breaking
supersymmetry. In these models, the gravitino is the LSP and develops a mass by
eating the axino mode. The radial component of the axion supermultiplet known
as the saxion typically begins to oscillate in the early Universe, eventually
coming to dominate the energy density. Its decay reheats the Universe to a
temperature of ~ 1 GeV, igniting BBN and diluting all thermal relics such as
the gravitino by a factor of ~ 10^(-4) - 10^(-5) such that gravitinos
contribute a sizable component of the dark matter. In certain cases,
non-thermally produced relics such as the axion, or gravitinos generated from
the decay of the saxion can also contribute to the abundance of dark matter.
Remarkably enough, this cosmological scenario turns out to be independent of
the initial reheating temperature of the Universe. This is due to the fact that
the initial oscillation temperature of the saxion coincides with the freeze out
temperature for gravitinos in F-theory GUTs. We also find that saxion dilution
is compatible with generating the desired baryon asymmetry from standard
leptogenesis. Finally, the gravitino mass range in F-theory GUTs is 10-100 MeV,
which interestingly coincides with the window of values required for the decay
of the NLSP to solve the problem of Li(7) over-production.

CMEs. The Aly-Sturrock conjecture states that the magnetic energy of a given
force free boundary field is maximized when the field is open. This is
problematic for CME initiation because it leaves little or no magnetic energy
to drive the eruption, unless reconnection is present to allow some of the
field to escape without opening. Thus, it has been thought that reconnection
must be present to initiate CMEs. This theory has not been subject to rigorous
numerical testing because conventional MHD numerical models contain numerical
diffusion, which introduces uncontrolled numerical reconnection. We use a
quasi-Lagrangian simulation technique to run the first controlled experiments
of CME initiation in the complete lack of reconnection. We find that a flux
rope confined by an arcade, when twisted beyond a critical amount, can escape
to an open state, allowing some of the surrounding arcade to shrink and
releasing magnetic energy from the global field. This mechanism includes a true
ideal MHD instability. We conclude that reconnection is not a necessary trigger
for fast CME eruptions.

the chain-flip move is necessary for the simulation to find an ordered ground

non-extensive entropy are found, and two special values of h exist where the
residual entropy again becomes extensive, scaling proportional to N ln phi,

networks challenging. We present an approximation that allows the calculation
of not only the mean and variance but also the distribution of protein numbers.
We assume that proteins decay substantially slower than their mRNA and confirm
that many genes satisfy this relation using high-throughput data from budding
yeast. For a two-stage model of gene expression, with transcription and
translation as first-order reactions, we calculate the protein distribution for
all times greater than several mRNA lifetimes and thus qualitatively predict
the distribution of times for protein levels to first cross an arbitrary
threshold. If in addition the promoter fluctuates between inactive and active
states, we can find the steady-state protein distribution, which can be bimodal
if promoter fluctuations are slow. We show that our assumptions imply that
protein synthesis occurs in geometrically distributed bursts and allows mRNA to
be eliminated from a master equation description. In general, we find that
protein distributions are asymmetric and may be poorly characterized by their
mean and variance. Through maximum likelihood methods, our expressions should
therefore allow more quantitative comparisons with experimental data. More
generally, we introduce a technique to derive a simpler, effective dynamics for
a stochastic system by eliminating a fast variable.

flows parallel to the magnet/nonmagnet interface, are investigated
theoretically using the nonequilibrium Keldysh theory. In the first geometry,
the current is perpendicular to the polarizing magnet/nonmagnet interface but
parallel to the nonmagnet/switching magnet interface (CPIP). In the second
geometry, the current is parallel to both the polarizing magnet/nonmagnet and
nonmagnet/switching magnet interfaces (CIP). Calculations for a single-orbital
tight binding model indicate that the spin current flowing parallel to the
switching magnet/nonmagnet interface can be absorbed by a lateral switching
magnet as efficiently as in the traditional current-perpendicular-to-plane
(CPP) geometry. The results of the model calculations are shown to be valid
also for experimentally relevant Co/Cu CPIP system described by fully realistic
tight binding bands fitted to an ab initio band structure. It is shown that
almost complete absorption of the incident spin current by a lateral switching
magnet occurs when the lateral dimensions of the switching magnet are of the
order of 50-100 interatomic distances, i.e., about 20nm and its height as small
as a few atomic planes. It is also demonstratedthat strong spin current
absorption in the CPIP/CIP geometry is not spoilt by the presence of a rough
interface between the switching magnet and nonmagnetic spacer. Polarization
achieved using a lateral magnet in the CIP geometry is found to be about 25% of
that in the traditional CPP geometry. The present CPIP calculations of the spin
transfer torque are also relevant to the so called pure-spin-current-induced
magnetization switching that had been recently observed.

at the orbital period of this TeV gamma-ray emitting system.The X-ray emission
shows a minimum at orbital phase ~ 0.1, close to the so-called superior
conjunction of the compact object, and a maximum at phase ~0.7, very close to
the inferior conjunction of the compact object. The X-ray spectral data up to
70 keV are described by a hard power-law with a phase-dependent photon index
which varies within Gamma ~1.45 - 1.61. The amplitude of the flux variation is
a factor of 2.5, but is significantly less than that of the factor ~8 variation
in the TeV flux. Otherwise the two light curves are similar, but not identical.
Although periodic X-ray emission has been found from many galactic binary
systems, the Suzaku result implies a phenomenon different from the ""standard""
origin of X-rays related to the emission of the hot accretion plasma formed
around the compact companion object. The X-ray radiation of LS5039is likely to
be linked to very-high-energy electrons which are also responsible for the TeV
gamma-ray emission. While the gamma-rays are the result of inverse Compton
scattering by electrons on optical stellar photons, X-rays are produced via
synchrotron radiation. Yet, while the modulation of the TeV gamma-ray signal
can be naturally explained by the photon-photon pair production and anisotropic
inverse Compton scattering, the observed modulation of synchrotron X-rays
requires an additional process, the most natural one being adiabatic expansion
in the radiation production region.

incomplete inner shell that resembles a one-arm spiral starting at or close to

rich envelopes. Near the systemic velocity, the hollow shell is fragmented into
several large blobs or arcs with missing portions correspond spatially to
locations of previously reported high--velocity outlows in the Egg nebula. This
provides direct evidence for the disruption of the slowly--expanding envelope
ejected during the AGB phase by the collimated fast outflows initiated during
the transition to the protoplanetary nebula phase. We also find that the
intersection of fast molecular outflows previously suggested as the location of
the central post-AGB star is significantly offset from the center of the hollow

the spatial kinematics of the HC$_3$N J=5--4 emission using a HC$_3$N shell
with two pairs of cavities cleared by the collimated high velocity outflows
along the polar direction and in the equatorial plane. We infer a relatively
high abundance of HC$_3$N/H$_2$ $\sim$3x10$^{-6}$ for an estimated mass--loss

combined with further studies on variations of constants in other physical
processes to constrain models of grand unification (GUT) and quintessence. We
will find that the 7Li problem of BBN can be ameliorated if one allows for
varying constants, where especially varying light quark masses show a strong
influence. Furthermore, we show that recent studies of varying constants are in
contradiction with each other and BBN in the framework of six exemplary GUT
scenarios, if one assumes monotonic variation with time. We conclude that there
is strong tension between recent claims of varying constants, hence either some
claims have to be revised, or there are much more sophisticated GUT relations
(and/or non-monotonic variations) realized in nature. The methods introduced in
this thesis prove to be powerful tools to probe regimes well beyond the
Standard Model of particle physics or the concordance model of cosmology, which
are currently inaccessible by experiments. Once the first irrefutable proofs of
varying constants are available, our method will allow for probing the
consistency of models beyond the standard theories like GUT or quintessence and
also the compatibility between these models.

investigated the power of mismatch distribution analysis and the F(S) test with
coalescent simulations of different demographic scenarios. We then applied
these methods to empirical data obtained for the Canary Island pine (Pinus
canariensis). The results of the simulations showed that chloroplast
microsatellites are sensitive to sudden population growth. The power of the
F(S) test and accuracy of demographic parameter estimates, such as the time of
expansion, were reduced proportionally to the level of homoplasy within the
data. The analysis of Canary Island pine chloroplast microsatellite data
indicated population expansions for almost all sample localities. Demographic
expansions at the island level can be explained by the colonization of the
archipelago by the pine, while population expansions of different ages in
different localities within an island could be the result of local extinctions
and recolonization dynamics. Comparable mitochondrial DNA sequence data from a
parasite of P. canariensis, the weevil Brachyderes rugatus, supports this
scenario, suggesting a key role for volcanism in the evolution of pine forest
communities in the Canary Islands.

approach. In particular, we show that initial azimuthally asymmetric transverse
flow develops for non-central collisions as a consequence of the sudden
equilibration. Moreover, the energy-momentum tensor from the free-streaming
stage matches very smoothly to the form used in the transverse hydrodynamics,
whereas matching to isotropic hydrodynamics requires a more pronounced change
in the energy-momentum tensor. After the hydrodynamic phase statistical
hadronization is carried out with the help of THERMINATOR. The physical results
for the transverse-momentum spectra, the elliptic-flow, and the
Hanbury-Brown--Twiss correlation radii, including the ratio R_out/R_side as
well as the dependence of the radii on the azimuthal angle (azHBT), are
properly described within our approach. The agreement is equally good for a
purely hydrodynamic evolution started at an early proper time of 0.25 fm/c, or
for the free streaming started at that time, followed by the sudden
equilibration at tau ~1 fm/c and then by perfect hydrodynamics. Thus, the
inclusion of free streaming allows us to delay the start of hydrodynamics to
more realistic times of the order of 1 fm/c.

orbits, due to the presence of a stellar cusp, induces coherent torques that
amplify deviations of individual orbital eccentricities from the average, and
thus drive all eccentricities away from their initial value. We investigate the
instability using N-body simulations, and show that it can drive individual
orbital eccentricities to significantly higher or lower values on the order of
a precession time-scale. This physics is relevant for the Galactic center,
where massive stars are likely to form in eccentric disks around the SgrA*

stars in the Galactic center is in good agreement with the distribution

evolution of such a disk results in several of its stars acquiring high (1-e <

prefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies with
substantial levels of star formation. Specifically, AGNs with host masses
between 0.25-1x10^11 Msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,
field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color or
specific star formation rate. Host galaxies having M_*>10^11 Msun clearly
illustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantly
bluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lower
density regions analogous to SDSS studies of narrow-line AGN. To probe the
environment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies
(M_*>2.5x10^10 Msun) hosting AGNs inside optically-selected groups, and find no
significant difference with field galaxies. We interpret our results as
evidence that AGN activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probability
of a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidence
by its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptive

through identification studies. Aims: We study the molecular gas content in two
SMGs, SMMJ163555 and SMMJ163541, at z=1.034 and z=3.187 with unlensed submm
fluxes of 0.4mJy and 6.0mJy. Both SMGs are gravitationally lensed by the
foreground cluster A2218. Methods: IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometry
observations at 3mm were obtained for the lines CO(2-1) for SMMJ163555 and
CO(3-2) for SMMJ163541. Additionally we obtained CO(4-3) for the candidate
z=4.048 SMMJ163556 with an unlensed submm flux of 2.7mJy. Results: CO(2-1) was
detected for SMMJ163555 at z=1.0313 with an integrated line intensity of
1.2+-0.2Jy km/s and a line width of 410+-120 km/s. From this a gas mass of
1.6x10^9 Msun is derived and a star formation efficiency of 440Lsun/Msun is
estimated. CO(3-2) was detected for SMMJ163541 at z=3.1824, possibly with a
second component at z=3.1883, with an integrated line intensity of 1.0+-0.1 Jy
km/s and a line width of 280+-50 km/s. From this a gas mass of 2.2x10^10 Msun
is derived and a star formation efficiency of 1000 Lsun/Msun is estimated. For
SMMJ163556 the CO(4-3) is undetected within the redshift range 4.035-4.082 down
to a sensitivity of 0.15 Jy km/s. Conclusions: Our CO line observations confirm
the optical redshifts for SMMJ163555 and SMMJ163541. The CO line luminosity
L'_CO for both galaxies is consistent with the L_FIR-L'_CO relation. SMMJ163555
has the lowest FIR luminosity of all SMGs with a known redshift and is one of
the few high redshift LIRGs whose properties can be estimated prior to ALMA.

examine these fluctuations, including, for the first time, those during the

between HeII/HI show even larger fluctuations, which may be due to more
complicated radiative transfer effects. During reionization, the fluctuations
are even stronger. In contrast to hydrogen reionization, our model predicts
that regions with strong HeII Lyman-alpha forest transmission should be
reasonably common even during the beginning stages of reionization, because of
strong illumination from bright quasars. Partly due to this, the mean ionizing
background does not evolve strongly during and after helium reionization; it is
roughly proportional to the filling fraction of HeIII regions. On the other
hand, regions full of HeII and also ""fossil"" ionized regions that contain no
(or few) active sources appear as strong IGM absorbers. Their presence
exaggerates the evolution of the hardness ratio, making it evolve faster than
naively expected during the reionization era.

three Weyl group orbits of equilibria. These coordinate type Cartan subalgebras

non-Hermitian in a Hilbert space with the Dirac sense inner product, it is
Hermitian in a Hilbert space endowed by the inner product $<n|\eta|m>$ as well
as having a correct-sign propagator (no Lee-Wick fields). Besides, the obtained
metric operator also diagonalizes the Hamiltonian in the two fields (no
mixing). Moreover, the Hermiticity of $\eta$ constrained the two Higgs masses
to be related as $M>2m$, which has been obtained in another work using a very
different regime and thus supports our calculation. Also, an equivalent

that can occur in supersymmetric field theories, along with explicit models in
which they arise. The first vacuum structure is one in which supersymmetry is
broken at tree-level in a perturbative theory that also contains a
supersymmetry-preserving ground state. Models realizing this structure are
uniquely characterized by the fact that no flat directions appear in the
classical potential, all vacua appear at finite distances in field space, and
no non-perturbative physics is required for vacuum stability. The second
non-trivial vacuum structure we discuss consists of large (and even infinite)
towers of metastable vacua, and we show that models which give rise to such
vacuum towers exhibit a rich set of instanton-induced vacuum tunneling
dynamics. Finally, our third new non-trivial vacuum structure consists of an
infinite number of degenerate vacua; this leads to a Bloch-wave ground state
and a vacuum ""band"" structure. Models with such characteristics therefore
experience time-dependent vacuum oscillations. Needless to say, these novel
vacuum structures lead to many new potential applications for supersymmetric
field theories, ranging from the cosmological-constant problem to the string
landscape, supersymmetry breaking, and Z' phenomenology.

for the description of biomolecular folding pathways, which is however
difficult in both experiments and computer simulations. Such transient states
are typically of low population in simulation samples. Even for simple systems
such as RNA hairpins, recently there are mounting debates over the existence of
multiple intermediate states. In this paper, we develop a computational
approach to explore the relatively low populated transition or intermediate
states in biomolecular folding pathways, based on a topological data analysis
tool, Mapper, with simulation data from large-scale distributed computing. The
method is inspired by the classical Morse theory in mathematics which
characterizes the topology of high dimensional shapes via some functional level
sets. In this paper we exploit a conditional density filter which enables us to
focus on the structures on pathways, followed by clustering analysis on its
level sets, which helps separate low populated intermediates from high
populated uninteresting structures. A successful application of this method is
given on a motivating example, a RNA hairpin with GCAA tetraloop, where we are
able to provide structural evidence from computer simulations on the multiple
intermediate states and exhibit different pictures about unfolding and
refolding pathways. The method is effective in dealing with high degree of
heterogeneity in distribution, capturing structural features in multiple
pathways, and being less sensitive to the distance metric than nonlinear
dimensionality reduction or geometric embedding methods. It provides us a
systematic tool to explore the low density intermediate states in complex
biomolecular folding systems.

(PQ). This is a quantum analogue of PAC, where during the testing phase the

  We demonstrate a relational concept class that is efficiently learnable in
PQ, while in any ""reasonable"" classical model exponential amount of training
data would be required. This is the first unconditional separation between
quantum and classical learning.
  We show that our separation is the best possible in several ways; in
particular, there is no analogous result for a functional class, as well as for
several weaker versions of quantum learning. In order to demonstrate tightness
of our separation we consider a special case of one-way communication that we
call single-input mode, where Bob receives no input. Somewhat surprisingly,
this setting becomes nontrivial when relational communication tasks are
considered. In particular, any problem with two-sided input can be transformed
into a single-input relational problem of equal classical one-way cost. We show
that the situation is different in the quantum case, where the same
transformation can make the communication complexity exponentially larger. This
happens if and only if the original problem has exponential gap between quantum
and classical one-way communication costs. We believe that these auxiliary
results might be of independent interest.

and detachment from clusters, where the detachment rates decrease with
increasing cluster size as gamma(m) ~ m^{-k}, k>0. Heuristic scaling arguments
based on random walk properties show that the typical cluster size scales as
(t/ln(t))^z, with z=1/(k+2). The initial symmetric flux of particles between
neighboring clusters is followed by an effectively assymmetric flux due to the
unbalanced detachement rates, which leads to the above logarithmic correction.
Small clusters have densities of order t^{-mz(1)}, with z(1) = k/(k+2). Thus,
for k<1, the small clusters (mass of order unity) are statistically dominant
and the average cluster size does not scale as the size of typically large
clusters does. We also solve the Master equation of the model under an
independent interval approximation, which yields cluster distributions and
exponent relations and gives the correct dominant coarsening exponent after
accounting for the effects of correlations. The coarsening of large clusters is
described by the distribution P_t(m) ~ 1/t^y f(m/t^z), with y=2z. All results
are confirmed by simulation, which also illustrates the unusual features of
cluster size distributions, with a power law decay for small masses and a
negatively skewed peak in the scaling region. The detachment rates considered
here can apply in the presence of strong attractive interactions, and recent
applications suggest that even more rapid rate decays are also physically
realistic.

field associated with a pre-existing extended structure. The global B field

Evolution equations are derived at a quadratically nonlinear level for the

the direction of propagation relative to the crystal axes. A single equation is
found for all propagation directions for quasi-longitudinal waves, but a pair
of coupled equations occurs for quasi-transverse waves propagating along
directions of degeneracy, or acoustic axes. The coupled equations involve four
material parameters but they simplify if the wave propagates along an axis of

equations decouple if the axis is four-fold or higher. In the absence of a

the existence of disorder induced localized states, which do not conduct

localization is much more general and applies to almost any type of propagation
in time or space, when more than one parameter is relevant (like phase and
amplitude). Here we propose a new optical scheme to literally see Anderson
localization by varying the optical wavelength or angle of incidence to tune
between localized and delocalized states. The occurrence of Anderson
localization in the propagation of light, in particular, has become the focus
of tremendous interest due to the emergence of new optical technologies and
media, such as low dimensional and disordered optical lattices. While several
experiments have reported the measurement of Anderson localization of light,
many of the observations remain controversial because the effects of absorption
and localization have a similar signature, i.e., exponential decrease of the
transmission with the system size. In this work, we discuss a system, where we
can clearly differentiate between absorption and localization effects because
this system is equivalent to a perfect filter, only in the absence of any
absorption. Indeed, only one wavelength is perfectly transmitted and all others
are fully localized. These results were obtained by developing a new
theoretical framework for the average optical transmission through disordered

interstellar medium (ISM). The typical velocity of dust grain as a function of
grain size has been calculated for various ISM phases based on a theory of
grain dynamics in compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. In this paper,
we develop a scheme of grain shattering and coagulation and apply it to
turbulent ISM by using the grain velocities predicted by the above turbulence
theory. Since large grains tend to acquire large velocity dispersions as shown
by earlier studies, large grains tend to be shattered. Large shattering effects
are indeed seen in warm ionized medium (WIM) within a few Myr for grains with
radius $a\ga 10^{-6}$ cm. We also show that shattering in warm neutral medium
(WNM) can limit the largest grain size in ISM ($a\sim 2\times 10^{-5}
\mathrm{cm}$). On the other hand, coagulation tends to modify small grains
since it only occurs when the grain velocity is small enough. Coagulation
significantly modifies the grain size distribution in dense clouds (DC), where
a large fraction of the grains with $a<10^{-6}$ cm coagulate in 10 Myr. In
fact, the correlation among $R_V$, the carbon bump strength, and the
ultraviolet slope in the observed Milky Way extinction curves can be explained
by the coagulation in DC. It is possible that the grain size distribution in
the Milky Way is determined by a combination of all the above effects of
shattering and coagulation. Considering that shattering and coagulation in
turbulence are effective if dust-to-gas ratio is typically more than $\sim
1/10$ of the Galactic value, the regulation mechanism of grain size
distribution should be different between metal-poor and metal-rich
environments.

of stationary phase approximation (SPA). In the long time limit, depending on
the network size $N$ and parameter $m$, the limiting probability distributions
of quantum transport show various patterns. When the network size $N$ is an
even number, we find an asymmetric transition probability of quantum transport
between the initial node and its opposite node. This asymmetry depends on the
precise values of $N$ and $m$. Finally, we study the transport processes in the
presence of traps and find that the survival probability decays faster on

space-time is cut into 4-simplices, the connection describes how to glue these

developed and applied to the analysis of radio pulsar polarization. The new
formalism provides an elementary statistical explanation of the modal
broadening phenomenon in single pulse observations. It is also used to argue
that the degree of polarization of giant pulses has been poorly defined in past
studies. Single and giant pulse polarimetry typically involves sources with
large flux densities and observations with high time resolution, factors that
necessitate consideration of source-intrinsic noise and small-number
statistics. Self noise is shown to fully explain the excess polarization
dispersion previously noted in single pulse observations of bright pulsars,
obviating the need for additional randomly polarized radiation. Rather, these
observations are more simply interpreted as an incoherent sum of covariant,
orthogonal, partially polarized modes. Based on this premise, the
four-dimensional covariance matrix of the Stokes parameters may be used to
derive mode-separated pulse profiles without any assumptions about the
intrinsic degrees of mode polarization. Finally, utilizing the small-number

spherically symmetric solutions may naturally evolve to a self-similar form in
certain circumstances. In this context, the validity of the corresponding
hypothesis in nonspherical geometry is very interesting as there may exist
gravitational waves. We investigate self-similar vacuum solutions to the
Einstein equation in the so-called whole-cylinder symmetry. We find that those
solutions are reduced to part of the Minkowski spacetime with a regular or
conically singular axis and with trivial or nontrivial topology if the
homothetic vector is orthogonal to the cylinders of symmetry. These solutions
are analogous to the Milne universe, but only in the direction parallel to the
axis. Using these solutions, we discuss the nonuniqueness (and nonvanishing
nature) of C energy and the existence of a cylindrical trapping horizon in
Minkowski spacetime. Then, as we generalize the analysis, we find a
two-parameter family of self-similar vacuum solutions, where the homothetic
vector is not orthogonal to the cylinders in general. The family includes the
Minkowski, the Kasner and the cylindrical Milne solutions. The obtained
solutions describe the interior to the exploding (imploding) shell of
gravitational waves or the collapse (explosion) of gravitational waves
involving singularities from nonsingular initial data in general. Since recent
numerical simulations strongly suggest that one of these solutions may describe
the asymptotic behavior of gravitational waves from the collapse of a dust
cylinder, this means that the self-similarity hypothesis is naturally
generalized to cylindrical symmetry.

For some systems,
this means that the functional significance of the vertices is also broadly
distributed, in other cases the vertices are equally significant, but in
different ways. One example of the latter case is metabolic networks, where the
high-degree vertices -- the currency metabolites -- supply the molecular groups
to the low-degree metabolites, and the latter are responsible for the
higher-order biological function, of vital importance to the organism. In this
paper, we propose a generalization of currency metabolites to currency
vertices. We investigate the network structural characteristics of such

metabolic networks, we find that a network of music collaborations and a
network of e-mail exchange could be described by a division of the vertices

not only the anisotropy of the continuum radiation, but also the
symmetry-breaking effects caused by the horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities
produced by the solar surface convection. Interestingly, our radiative transfer
modeling in a well-known 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere shows
remarkable agreement with the empirical data, significantly better than that
obtained via the use of 1D atmospheric models. Although this result confirms
that the above-mentioned 3D model was indeed a suitable choice for our
Hanle-effect estimation of the substantial amount of ""hidden"" magnetic energy
that is stored in the quiet solar photosphere, we have found however some small
discrepancies whose origin may be due to uncertainties in the empirical data
and/or in the thermal and density structure of the 3D model. For this reason,
we have paid some attention also to other (more familiar) observables, like the
center-limb variation of the continuum intensity, which we have calculated
taking into account the scattering contribution to the continuum source
function. The overall agreement with the observed center-limb variation turns
out to be impressive, but we find a hint that the model's temperature gradients
in the continuum forming layers could be slightly too steep, perhaps because
all current simulations of solar surface convection and magnetoconvection
compute the radiative flux divergence ignoring the fact that the effective
polarizability is not completely negligible, especially in the downward-moving

pulses occur primarily as solutions to the RD equations while augmented
transmission changes excitability. For certain ranges of the parameter
settings, defined as weak susceptibility and moderate control, respectively,
the hybrid model can be mapped to the original RD model. This results in an
effective change of RD parameters controlled by augmented transmission. Outside
moderate control parameter settings new patterns are obtained, for example
step-wise propagation due to delay-induced oscillations. Augmented transmission
constitutes a signaling system complementary to the classical RD mechanism of
pattern formation. Our hybrid model combines the two major signaling systems in

quantum mechanical model from the spatial freezing of a well known relativistic
field theory - the chiral Schwinger model. We apply the Hamiltonian constraint
analysis of Dirac [1] and find that the nature of constraints depends
critically on a $c$-number parameter present in the model. Thus a change in the
parameter alters the number of dynamical modes in an abrupt and
non-perturbative way.
  We have obtained new {\it{real}} energy levels for the quantum mechanical
model as we explore {\it{complex}} domains in the parameter space. These were
forbidden in the parent chiral Schwinger field theory where the analogue
Jackiw-Rajaraman parameter is restricted to be real. We explicitly show
existence of modes that satisfy higher derivative Pais-Uhlenbeck form of

rate of organisms are still controversial, while resolution may be further
complicated through the use of different and possibly inappropriate approaches
to statistical analysis. We propose the application of a modelling strategy
based on Akaike's information criteria and non-linear model fitting (nlm).
Accordingly, we collated and modelled available data at intraspecific level on
the individual standard metabolic rate of Antarctic microarthropods as a
function of body mass (M), temperature (T), species identity (S) and high rank
taxa to which species belong (G) and tested predictions from Metabolic Scaling
Theory. We also performed allometric analysis based on logarithmic
transformations (lm). Conclusions from lm and nlm approaches were different.
Best-supported models from lm incorporated T, M and S. The estimates of the
allometric scaling exponent b linking body mass and metabolic rate indicated no
interspecific difference and resulted in a value of 0.696 +/- 0.105 (mean +/-
95% CI). In contrast, the four best-supported nlm models suggested that both
the scaling exponent and activation energy significantly vary across the high
rank taxa to which species belong, with mean values of b ranging from about 0.6
to 0.8. We therefore reached two conclusions: 1) published analyses of
arthropod metabolism based on logarithmic data may be biased by data
transformation; 2) non-linear models applied to Antarctic microarthropod
metabolic rate suggest that intraspecific scaling of standard metabolic rate in
Antarctic microarthropods is highly variable and can be characterised by
scaling exponents that greatly vary within taxa, which may have biased previous
interspecific comparisons that neglected intraspecific variability.

However, they need exotic matters which are impossible in classical level to

to serve as a bridge connecting the classical theory and quantum gravity.
Therefore it provides a simple way for the study of quantum effect in the
semiclassical case. As is well known, loop quantum cosmology is very successful
to deal with the behavior of early universe. In the early stage, if taken the
quantum effect into consideration, inflation is natural because of the
violation of every kind of local energy conditions. Similar to the inflationary
universe, the violation of the averaged null energy condition is the necessary
condition for the traversable wormholes. In this paper, we investigate the

strongly between competing models of perturbation generation in the early

of WMAP observations have confirmed the general picture of the primordial power
spectrum as deviating slightly from scale invariance with a spectral tilt
parameter of n_s ~ 0.96. Nonetheless, many attempts have been made to isolate
further features such as breaks and cutoffs using a variety of methods, some
employing more than ~ 10 varying parameters. In this paper we apply the robust
technique of Bayesian model selection to reconstruct the optimal degree of
structure in the spectrum. We model the spectrum simply and generically as
piecewise linear in ln k between `nodes' in k-space whose amplitudes are
allowed to vary. The number of nodes and their k-space positions are chosen by
the Bayesian evidence so that we can identify both the complexity and location
of any detected features. Our optimal reconstruction contains, perhaps,
surprisingly few features, the data preferring just three nodes. This
reconstruction allows for a degree of scale dependence of the tilt with the
`turn-over' scale occuring around k ~ 0.016 Mpc^{-1}. More structure is
penalised by the evidence as over-fitting the data, so there is currently
little point in attempting reconstructions that are more complex.

about 150 clusters reveals ellipticities of observed clusters which are too low
(0.2 vs. 0.3), and offers the basis to find the main reason for this
discrepancy. The models predict that after $\approx 50$ Myr clusters reach an
oblate shape with an axes ratio of $1.65:1.35:1$, and with the major axis
tilted by an angle of $q_{XY} \approx 30^\circ$ with respect to the
Galactocentric radius due to differential rotation of the Galaxy. Unbiased
estimates of cluster shape parameters require reliable membership determination
in large cluster areas up to 2-3 tidal radii where the density of cluster stars
is considerably lower than the background. Although dynamically bound stars
outside the tidal radius contribute insignificantly to the cluster mass, their
distribution is essential for a correct determination of cluster shape
parameters. In contrast, a restricted mass range of cluster stars does not play
such a dramatic role, though deep surveys allow to identify more cluster
members and, therefore, to increase the accuracy of the observed shape
parameters.

recognized as a powerful tool for constraining dark energy. However, this
method relies on the knowledge of the size of the acoustic horizon at
recombination derived from Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy measurements.
This estimate is typically derived assuming a standard recombination scheme;
additional radiation sources can delay recombination altering the cosmic
ionization history and the cosmological inferences drawn from CMB and BAO data.
In this paper we quantify the effect of delayed recombination on the
determination of dark energy parameters from future BAO surveys such as BOSS
and WFMOS. We find the impact to be small but still not negligible. In
particular, if recombination is non-standard (to a level still allowed by CMB
data), but this is ignored, future surveys may incorrectly suggest the presence
of a redshift dependent dark energy component. On the other hand, in the case
of delayed recombination, adding to the analysis one extra parameter describing
deviations from standard recombination, does not significantly degrade the
error-bars on dark energy parameters and yields unbiased estimates.

system at T=0, we let it evolve at a fixed finite temperature. Depending on the
temperature T we find different scenarios for the aging behavior. For T>0.2 the
fractal structure is unstable and breaks up into small clusters which relax to
equilibrium. For T<0.2 the structure is stable and the dynamics slows down with
increasing waiting time. At intermediate and low T the mean squared
displacement scales as t^{2/3} and we discuss several mechanisms for this
anomalous time dependence. For intermediate T, the self-intermediate scattering
function is given by a compressed exponential at small wave-vectors and by a
stretched exponential at large wave-vectors. In contrast, for low T it is a
stretched exponential for all wave-vectors. This behavior can be traced back to
a subtle interplay between elastic rearrangements, fluctuations of chain-like

  Magnetic Field",,,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a non-relativistic electron interacting with a classical magnetic
field pointing along the $x_3$-axis and with a quantized electromagnetic field.
The system is translation invariant in the $x_3$-direction and we consider the
reduced Hamiltonian $H(P_3)$ associated with the total momentum $P_3$ along the
$x_3$-axis. For a fixed momentum $P_3$ sufficiently small, we prove that
$H(P_3)$ has a ground state in the Fock representation if and only if
$E'(P_3)=0$, where $P_3 \mapsto E'(P_3)$ is the derivative of the map $P_3
\mapsto E(P_3) = \inf \sigma (H(P_3))$. If $E'(P_3) \neq 0$, we obtain the
existence of a ground state in a non-Fock representation. This result holds for
sufficiently small values of the coupling constant.

focused at bringing in newcomers who have to deal with a digital document
project and are looking at the capacity that the TEI environment may have to
fulfil his needs. To this end, we avoid a strictly technical presentation of
the TEI and concentrate on the actual issues that such projects face, with
parallel made on the situation within two institutions. While a quick
walkthrough the TEI technical framework is provided, the papers ends up by
showing the essential role of the community in the actual technical
contributions that are being brought to the TEI.
