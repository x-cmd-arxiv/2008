calculations to determine the relationship between reionization history and
local environment in a volume 1 Gpc/h across and a resolution of about 1 Mpc.
We resolve the formation of about 2x10^6 halos of mass greater than ~10^12 Msun
at z=0, allowing us to determine the relationship between halo mass and
reionization epoch for galaxies and clusters. For our fiducial reionization
model, in which reionization begins at z~15 and ends by z~6, we find a strong
bias for cluster-size halos to be in the regions which reionized first, at
redshifts 10<z<15. Consequently, material in clusters was reionized within
relatively small regions, on the order of a few Mpc, implying that all clusters
in our calculation were reionized by their own progenitors. Milky Way mass
halos were on average reionized later and by larger regions, with a
distribution similar to the global one, indicating that low mass halos are
relatively uncorrelated with reionization when only their mass is taken as a
prior. On average, we find that most halos with mass less than 10^13 Msun were
reionized internally, while almost all halos with masses greater than 10^14
Msun were reionized by their own progenitors. We briefly discuss the
implications of this work in light of the ""missing satellites"" problem and how
this new approach may be extended further.

directly measure the Universe expansion history, and to set limits to space
curvature when combined to the angular BAO signal. In addition to spectroscopic
surveys, radial BAO might be measured from accurate enough photometric
redshifts obtained with narrow-band filters. We explore the requirements for a
photometric survey using Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) to competitively measure
the radial BAO signal and discuss the possible systematic errors of this
approach. If LRG were a highly homogeneous population, we show that the photo-z
accuracy would not substantially improve by increasing the number of filters
beyond $\sim 10$, except for a small fraction of the sources detected at high
signal-to-noise, and broad-band filters would suffice to achieve the target
$\sigma_z = 0.003 (1+z)$ for measuring radial BAO. Using the LRG spectra
obtained from SDSS, we find that the spectral variability of LRG substantially
worsens the achievable photometric redshift errors, and that the optimal system
consists of $\sim$ 30 filters of width $\Delta \lambda / \lambda \sim 0.02$. A
$S/N > 20$ is generally necessary at the filters on the red side of the
$H\alpha$ break to reach the target photometric accuracy. We estimate that a
5-year survey in a dedicated telescope with etendue in excess of 60 ${\rm m}^2
{\rm deg}^2$ would be necessary to obtain a high enough density of galaxies to
measure radial BAO with sufficiently low shot noise up to $z= 0.85$. We
conclude that spectroscopic surveys have a superior performance than
photometric ones for measuring BAO in the radial direction.

holes cannot be universal in different particle species. This creates a puzzle,
since it conflicts with the thermal nature of quasi-classical black holes,
according to which all the species should see the same horizon and be produced
with the same Hawking temperatures. We resolve this puzzle by showing that for
the microscopic black holes, on top the usual quantum evaporation time, there
is a new time-scale which characterizes a purely classical process during which
the black hole looses the ability to differentiate among the species, and
becomes democratic. We demonstrate this phenomenon in a well-understood
framework of large extra dimensions, with a number of parallel branes. An
initially non-democratic black hole is the one localized on one of the branes,
with its high-dimensional Schwarzschild radius being much shorter than the
interbrane distance. Such a black hole seemingly cannot evaporate into the
species localized on the other branes, that are beyond its reach. We
demonstrate that in reality the system evolves classically in time, in such a
way that the black hole accretes the neighboring branes. The end result is a
completely democratic static configuration, in which all the branes share the
same black hole, and all the species are produced with the same Hawking
temperature. Thus, just like their macroscopic counterparts, the microscopic
black holes are universal bridges to the hidden sector physics.

supergravity developed in arXiv:0805.4683, we elaborate two approaches to
reduce the superfield action to components. One of them is based on the
principle of projective invariance which is a purely N = 2 concept having no
analogue in simple supergravity. In this approach, the component reduction of
the action is performed without imposing any Wess-Zumino gauge condition, that
is by keeping intact all the gauge symmetries of the superfield action,
including the super-Weyl invariance. As a simple application, the c-map is
derived for the first time from superfield supergravity. Our second approach to
component reduction is based on the method of normal coordinates around a
submanifold in a curved superspace, which we develop in detail. We derive
differential equations which are obeyed by the vielbein and the connection in
normal coordinates, and which can be used to reconstruct these objects, in
principle in closed form. A separate equation is found for the
super-determinant of the vielbein, which allows one to reconstruct it without a
detailed knowledge of the vielbein. This approach is applicable to any
supergravity theory in any number of space-time dimensions. As a simple
application of this construction, we reduce an integral over the curved N = 2
superspace to that over the chiral subspace of the full superspace. We also
give a new representation for the curved projective-superspace action principle
as a chiral integral.

strongly reduce the total system throughput. We explore how photometric
redshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing the
survey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshift
estimates. For a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging area
of 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both in
completeness depth and precision, than systems with n_f >= 8 filters. Our
results suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm the
improvements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effective
photometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width than
naively expected from the reduction in S/N. Adding near-IR observations
improves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system which
maximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters with
logarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-band
overlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5
filter systems. A system with 20 constant-width, non-overlapping filters
reaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precision
almost 3 times better, dz = 0.014(1+z) vs. dz = 0.042(1+z). We briefly discuss
a practical implementation of such a photometric system: the ALHAMBRA survey.

non-axisymmetric oscillations of rapidly rotating and superfluid neutron stars.
We consider perturbations of Newtonian axisymmetric background configurations
and account for the presence of superfluid components via the standard
two-fluid model. Within the Cowling approximation, we are able to carry out
evolutions for uniformly rotating stars up to the mass-shedding limit. This
leads to the first detailed analysis of superfluid neutron star oscillations in
the fast rotation regime, where the star is significantly deformed by the
centrifugal force. For simplicity, we focus on background models where the two
fluids (superfluid neutrons and protons) co-rotate, are in beta-equilibrium and
coexist throughout the volume of the star. We construct sequences of rotating
stars for two analytical model equations of state. These models represent
relatively simple generalisations of single fluid, polytropic stars. We study
the effects of entrainment, rotation and symmetry energy on non-radial
oscillations of these models. Our results show that entrainment and symmetry
energy can have a significant effect on the rotational splitting of
non-axisymmetric modes. In particular, the symmetry energy modifies the
inertial mode frequencies considerably in the regime of fast rotation.

  Pac. Volume 383, page 91",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shear flows have been prescribed in numerical models of coronal mass
ejections and flares for decades as a way of energizing magnetic fields to
erupt. While such shear flows have long been observed in the solar atmosphere,
until recently, there was no compelling physical explanation for them. This
paper will discuss the discovery that such shear flows are readily explained as
a response to the Lorentz force that naturally occurs as bipolar magnetic
fields emerge and expand in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. It will be
shown that shearing motions transport axial flux, and magnetic energy from the
submerged portion of the field to the expanding portion, strongly coupling the
solar interior to the corona. This physical process explains active region
shear flows and why the magnetic field is found to be nearly parallel to
photospheric polarity inversion lines where prominences form. Finally, shear
flows driven by the Lorentz force are shown to produce a loss of equilibrium
and eruption in magnetic arcades and flux ropes offering a convincing
explanation for CMEs and flares.

additional constraints from the present direct Higgs searches at the Tevatron

probing regions of SUSY parameter space for low M_A and large tan beta, leading
to a preference for models with a lightest CP-even Higgs mass close to the

mini-halo, hence we present upper limits to the integrated, diffuse non-thermal
radio emission of the core of the Ophiuchus cluster. The XMM-Newton
observations can be well explained by a two-temperature thermal model with
temperatures of ~=1.8 keV and ~=9.0 keV, respectively, which confirms previous
results that suggest that the innermost central region of the Ophiuchus cluster
is a cooling core. We also used the XMM-Newton data to set up an upper limit to
the (non-thermal) X-ray emission from the cluster.
  The combination of available radio and X-ray data has strong implications for
the currently proposed models of the spectral energy distribution (SED) from
the Ophiuchus cluster. In particular, a synchrotron+IC model is in agreement
with the currently available data, if the average magnetic field is in the
range (0.02-0.3) microG. A pure WIMP annihilation scenario can in principle
reproduce both radio and X-ray emission, but at the expense of postulating very
large boost factors from dark matter substructures, jointly with extremely low
values of the average magnetic field. Finally, a scenario where synchrotron and
inverse Compton emission arise from PeV electron-positron pairs (via
interactions with the CMB), can be ruled out, as it predicts a non-thermal soft
X-ray emission that largely exceeds the thermal Bremsstrahlung measured by
INTEGRAL.

extends until the crossing of the local Fermi energy with the degeneracy point

under a general parameterization. In the model, the mean vector and the
covariance matrix share the same parameters. It includes many important
regression models available in the literature as special cases, such as
(non)linear regression, errors-in-variables models, and so forth. Moreover,
heteroscedastic situations may also be studied within our framework. We derive
a general expression for the second-order biases of maximum likelihood
estimates of the model parameters and show that it is always possible to obtain
the second order bias by means of ordinary weighted lest-squares regressions.
We enlighten such general expression with an errors-in-variables model and also
conduct some simulations in order to verify the performance of the corrected
estimates. The simulation results show that the bias correction scheme yields
nearly unbiased estimators. We also present an empirical ilustration.

outflows. Using a novel scheme to model the physics and spectral signatures of
gaseous winds from these objects, we are able to estimate the mass loss rates
and kinetic luminosities associated with the highly ionized gas and investigate
its physical properties. Our conclusions are as follows: 1) There is a strong
indication that the outflowing gas in those objects is multi-phase with similar
kinematics for the different phases. 2) The X-ray spectrum is consistent with
such flows being thermally driven from ~pc scales, and are therefore unlikely
to be associated with the inner accretion disk. 3) The underlying X-ray
spectrum consists of a hard X-ray powerlaw which is similar for all objects
shining below their Eddington rate and a soft excess whose contribution becomes
more prominent for objects shining close to their Eddington limit. 4) The
physical properties of the outflow are similar in all cases and a coherent
picture emerges concerning its physical properties. 5) The deduced mass loss
rates are, roughly, of the order of the mass accretion rate in those objects so
that the kinetic luminosity carried by such winds is only a tiny fraction
(<<1%) of the bolometric luminosity. We discuss the implications of our results

three right-handed singlet fermions. We show that the inflationary epoch is

We investigate the energy transfer from Higgs-inflaton to the SM particles and
show that the radiation dominated phase of the Universe expansion starts at
temperature T_r~(3-15)*10^{13} GeV, where the upper bound depends on the Higgs
boson mass. We estimate the production rate of singlet fermions at preheating
and find that their concentrations at T_r are negligibly small. This suggests
that the sterile neutrino Dark Matter (DM) production and baryogenesis in the
nuMSM with Higgs-driven inflation are low energy phenomena, having nothing to
do with inflation. We study then a modification of the nuMSM, adding to its
Lagrangian higher dimensional operators suppressed by the Planck scale. The
role of these operators in Higgs-driven inflation is clarified. We find that
these operators do not contribute to the production of Warm Dark Matter (WDM)
and to baryogenesis. We also demonstrate that the sterile neutrino with mass
exceeding 100 keV (a Cold Dark Matter (CDM) candidate) can be created during
the reheating stage of the Universe in necessary amounts. We argue that the
mass of DM sterile neutrino should not exceed few MeV in order not to overclose

which captures the transport of cooling radiation against opacity due to both
dust and gas (including the effects of dust sublimation, molecules, and H^-
ions). We also perform comparison simulations using a standard barotropic
equation of state. We find that -- when compared with the barotropic equation
of state -- our more realistic treatment of the energy equation results in more
protostellar objects being formed, and a higher proportion of brown dwarfs; the
multiplicity frequency is essentially unchanged, but the multiple systems tend
to have shorter periods (by a factor ~3), higher eccentricities, and higher
mass ratios. The reason for this is that small fragments are able to cool more
effectively with the new treatment, as compared with the barotropic equation of
state. We find that the process of fragmentation is often bimodal. The first
protostar to form is usually, at the end, the most massive, i.e. the primary.
However, frequently a disc-like structure subsequently forms round this
primary, and then, once it has accumulated sufficient mass, quickly fragments
to produce several secondaries. We believe that this delayed fragmentation of a
disc-like structure is likely to be an important source of very low-mass
hydrogen-burning stars and brown dwarfs.

in QCD to the presence of a non-zero density of quark modes at the low end of
the spectrum of the Dirac operator. Spectral observables like the number of
modes in a given energy interval are renormalizable and can therefore be
computed using the Wilson formulation of lattice QCD even though the latter
violates chiral symmetry at energies on the order of the inverse lattice
spacing. Using numerical simulations, we find (in two-flavour QCD) that the low
quark modes do condense in the expected way. In particular, the chiral
condensate can be accurately calculated simply by counting the low modes on
large lattices. Other spectral observables can be considered as well and have a
potentially wide range of uses.

discussed by Phafl et al. (2008) and earlier by Loeb and Gaudi (2003). The
effect is well known in the case of binary stars where it can produce light
curves with amplitutudes of ellipsoidal variations of about 0.1 mag for
distorted stars. For planets the effect is very small and usually less than
0.0001 mag. The detection of an exoplanet, by searching for small amplitude
ellipsoidal variations, will be very difficult and affected by other
photometric effects; however, it maybe possible for some extreme cases.
Observations of ellipsoidal variations can provide additional constraints on
the model of the system. Light curves for few star/planet systems have been
calculated using PHOEBE eclipsing binary software based on Wilson-Devinney
method. As an example of ellipsoidal variations the synthetic light curve for
tau Bootis is presented. The amplitude of ellipsoidal variation is 0.01 mmag.

characterize the optimal diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) curve for a

a compress-and-forward type relaying strategy in which the relay quantizes its
received signal and transmits the corresponding channel codeword. It is
noteworthy that, with this transmission protocol, the two transmissions in
opposite directions can achieve their respective single user optimal DMT
performances simultaneously, despite the interference they cause to each other.
Motivated by the optimality of this scheme in the case of the two-way relay

the one-way multi-hop MIMO relay channel for a half-duplex relay terminal, and
this scheme is shown to achieve the optimal DMT performance.

result in substantial reductions in the quality factor. Thus, understanding the
microwave vortex response in superconducting thin films is important for the
design of such circuits, including superconducting qubits and photon detectors,

the magnetic field and frequency dependence of the microwave response of a
small density of vortices in resonators fabricated from thin films of Re and
Al, which are common materials used in superconducting microwave circuits.
Above a certain threshold cooling field, which is different for the Re and Al

contribute greater loss and are influenced more strongly by flux creep effects
than in the Re resonators. This different behavior can be described in the

magnetic moments are reviewed. The most important neutrino electromagnetic
processes involving a direct neutrino coupling with photons (such as neutrino

fishes' weights and the inter-arrival times are given by the sequences of
i.i.d. random variables with known distribution functions. These distributions

measure is given by difference between the utility function dependent on size

the angler has another utility functions and another cost functions. In this
way, the angler's relative opinion about these two places is modeled. For
example, on the one place better sort of fish can be caught with bigger
probability or one of the places is more comfortable. Obviously our angler
wants to have as much satisfaction as possible and additionally he have to
leave the lake before the fixed moment. Therefore his goal is to find two
optimal stopping times in order to maximize his satisfaction. The first time
corresponds to the moment, when he eventually should change the place and the
second time, when he should stop fishing. These stopping times have to be less

undergo accretion-induced collapse (AIC) to a neutron star (NS) before a
thermonuclear explosion ensues. It has generally been assumed that AIC does not
produce a detectable supernova (SN). If, however, the progenitor WD is rapidly
rotating (as may be expected due to its prior accretion), a centrifugally
supported disk forms around the NS upon collapse. We calculate the subsequent
evolution of this accretion disk using time-dependent height-integrated
simulations with initial conditions taken from the AIC calculations of Dessart
et al. (2006). Initially, the disk is cooled by neutrinos and its composition
is driven neutron-rich (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.1) by electron captures.
However, as the disk viscously spreads, it is irradiated by neutrinos from the
central proto-NS, which dramatically alters its neutron-to-proton ratio. We
find that electron neutrino captures increase Ye to ~ 0.5 by the time that weak
interactions in the disk freeze out. Because the disk becomes radiatively
inefficient and begins forming alpha-particles soon after freeze out, powerful
winds blow away most of the disk's remaining mass. These Ye ~ 0.5 outflows
synthesize up to a few times 1e-2 Msun in 56Ni. As a result, AIC may be
accompanied by a radioactively powered SN-like transient that peaks on a
timescale of ~ 1 day. Since few intermediate mass elements are likely
synthesized, these Ni-rich explosions should be spectroscopically distinct from
other SNe. PanSTARRs and the Palomar Transient Factory should detect a few AIC
transients per year if their true rate is ~1/100 of the Type Ia rate, and LSST
should detect hundreds per year. High cadence observations (< 1 day) are
optimal for the detection and follow-up of AIC (abridged).

sensitive mid-IR spectroscopic survey of PAH features toward a sample of

the embedded phase of star formation using radiative transfer modeling.
  VLT-ISAAC L-band spectra for 39 sources and Spitzer IRS spectra for 53
sources are presented. Line intensities are compared to recent surveys of
Herbig Ae/Be and T Tauri stars. The radiative transfer codes RADMC and RADICAL
are used to model the PAH emission from embedded YSOs consisting of a PMS star
with a circumstellar disk embedded in an envelope. The dependence of the PAH
feature on PAH abundance, stellar radiation field, inclination and the
extinction by the surrounding envelope is studied.
  The 3.3 micron PAH feature is undetected for the majority of the sample
(97%), with typical upper limits of 5E-16 W/m^2. Compact 11.2 micron PAH
emission is seen directly towards 1 out of the 53 Spitzer Short-High spectra,
for a source that is borderline embedded. For all 12 sources with both VLT and
Spitzer spectra, no PAH features are detected in either. In total, PAH features
are detected toward at most 1 out of 63 (candidate) embedded protostars (<~
2%), even lower than observed for class II T Tauri stars with disks (11-14%).
Assuming typical class I stellar and envelope parameters, the absence of PAHs
emission is most likely explained by the absence of emitting carriers through a
PAH abundance at least an order of magnitude lower than in molecular clouds but
similar to that found in disks. Thus, most PAHs likely enter the protoplanetary
disks frozen out in icy layers on dust grains and/or in coagulated form.

rational descendant Gromov-Witten invariants can be carried over to the
tropical world. Despite the fact that the tropical moduli-spaces we work with
are non-compact, the answer is surprisingly positive. We discuss the string,
divisor and dilaton equations, we prove a splitting lemma describing the
intersection with a ""boundary"" divisor and we prove general tropical versions
of the WDVV resp. topological recursion equations (under some assumptions). As
a direct application, we prove that the toric varieties $\mathbb{P}^1$,
$\mathbb{P}^2$, $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ and with Psi-conditions only
in combination with point conditions, the tropical and classical descendant
Gromov-Witten invariants coincide (which extends the result for $\mathbb{P}^2$
in Markwig-Rau-2008). Our approach uses tropical intersection theory and can
unify and simplify some parts of the existing tropical enumerative geometry
(for rational curves).

radius than any previously published submm detections of this galaxy. The
overall submm morphology and spatial spectral energy distribution of M82 have a
general north-south asymmetry consistent with H-alpha and X-ray winds,
supporting the association of the extended continuum with outflows of dust
grains from the disk into the halo. The new data raise interesting points about
the origin and structure of the submm emission in the inner disk of M82. In
particular, SCUBA short wavelength evidence of submm continuum peaks that are
asymmetrically distributed along the galactic disk suggests the inner-disk
emission is re-radiation from dust concentrations along a bar (or perhaps a
spiral) rather than edges of a dust torus, as is commonly assumed. Higher
resolution submm interferometery data from the Smithsonian Submillimeter Array
and later Atacama Large Millimeter Array should spatially resolve and further
constrain the reported dust emission structures in M82.

sensitivity to sterile neutrinos at a Neutrino Factory can be achieved using
the \nu_\mu ->\nu_\mu and the \nu_\mu ->\nu_\tau oscillations. We have studied
two setups: a Neutrino Factory with 50 GeV (20 GeV) stored muons, with two
detectors of the Hybrid-MIND type (a magnetized ECC next to a magnetized iron
calorimeter), located at L=3000, 7500 km (L=4000, 7500 km) from the source.
Four channels have been used: \nu_e -> \nu_\mu,\nu_\tau; \nu_\mu ->
\nu_\mu,\nu_\tau. The relevant backgrounds, efficiencies and systematic errors
have been taken into account, and we have discussed dependence of the
sensitivities on the systematic errors. We have found that the 50 GeV (20 GeV)

a homogenous two-fluid stellar model in Newtonian gravity. Next the coupling
effect between the two fluids is studied via a parameterized model of
entrainment. We find that the coupling in general breaks the universal behavior
seen in the case of decoupled fluids. Based on a relativistic variational
principle, an approximated expression is derived for the first-order shift of

source under squared error distortion. The decoder, besides receiving the
encoder's description, also observes side information consisting of
uncompressed source symbol subject to slow fading and noise. The decoder knows
the fading realization but the encoder knows only its distribution. The
rate-distortion function that simultaneously satisfies the distortion
constraints for all fading states was derived by Heegard and Berger. A layered
encoding strategy is considered in which each codeword layer targets a given
fading state. When the side-information channel has two discrete fading states,
the expected distortion is minimized by optimally allocating the encoding rate
between the two codeword layers. For multiple fading states, the minimum
expected distortion is formulated as the solution of a convex optimization
problem with linearly many variables and constraints. Through a limiting
process on the primal and dual solutions, it is shown that single-layer rate
allocation is optimal when the fading probability density function is
continuous and quasiconcave (e.g., Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami, and log-normal).
In particular, under Rayleigh fading, the optimal single codeword layer targets
the least favorable state as if the side information was absent.

monotonic gradients of the line of sight velocity along the loops and the large
velocity dispersions towards their foot points. It is suggested that these
loops are explained in terms of the buoyant rise of magnetic loops due to the
Parker instability. We have carried out global three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the gas disk in the Galactic center. The
gravitational potential is approximated by the axisymmetric potential proposed
by Miyamoto & Nagai (1975). At the initial state, we assume a warm (~ 10^4 K)
gas torus threaded by azimuthal magnetic fields. Self-gravity and radiative
cooling of the gas are ignored. We found that buoyantly rising magnetic loops
are formed above the differentially rotating, magnetically turbulent disk. By
analyzing the results of global MHD simulations, we have identified individual
loops, about 180 in the upper half of the disk, and studied their statistical
properties such as their length, width, height, and velocity distributions
along the loops. Typical length and height of a loop are 1kpc and 200pc,
respectively. The line of sight velocity changes linearly along a loop and
shows large dispersions around the foot-points. Numerical results indicate that
loops emerge preferentially from the region where magnetic pressure is large.
We argue that these properties are consistent with those of the molecular loops
discovered by NANTEN.

the couplings are between the bath and the spin. However, the small polaron
theory said that in the weak coupling and low temperature regime, the tunneling
is, in fact, dominated by the diagonal transitions whereas this diagonal
contribution to the tunneling should be faded away with increasing temperature.
Taking advantage of the analysis originated from the Feynman-Vernon's influence
functional theory, the influence on the tunneling by the phonon bath can be
expressed as a product of the effects of every single phonon mode, which can be
studied by numerical exact diagonalization. We find that, in the weak coupling
and low temperature regime, all the spin-single-mode systems exhibit the same
decreasing dependence of tunneling on increasing temperature. In turn, with the
conclusion of influence functional theory, the tunneling of the spin-boson
model should decrease and it is independent of the bath structure. In the
strong coupling regime, however, the temperature effect reverses from
suppressing to enhancing the tunneling with the increase of temperature.
Discrepancies between the old theories and the small polaron theory are also
explained.

halo are not blue and star forming, as expected in standard models of galaxy
formation, but are red. In contrast, this fraction is about 1/2 for dwarf
satellite galaxies. Many red dwarf galaxies are physically associated with more
massive halos. In total, about $\sim 45$% of red dwarf galaxies reside in
massive halos as satellites, while another $\sim 25$% have a spatial
distribution that is much more concentrated towards their nearest massive
haloes than other dwarf galaxies. We use mock catalogs to show that the reddest
population of non-satellite dwarf galaxies are distributed within about 3 times
the virial radii of their nearest massive halos. We suggest that this
population of dwarf galaxies are hosted by low-mass halos that have passed
through their massive neighbors, and that the same environmental effects that
cause satellite galaxies to become red are also responsible for the red colors
of this population of galaxies. We do not find any significant radial
dependence of the population of dwarf galaxies with the highest concentrations,
suggesting that the mechanisms operating on these galaxies affect color more
than structure. However, over 30% of dwarf galaxies are red and isolated and
their origin remains unknown.

two and four site dynamical mean field theory to solve a polaron model of
electrons coupled to a classical phonon field. The cluster size dependence of
the metal to polaronic insulator phase boundary is determined along with
electron spectral functions and cluster correlation functions. Pronounced
cluster size effects start to occur in the intermediate coupling region in
which the cluster calculation leads to a gap and the single-site approximation
does not. Differences (in particular a sharper band edge) persist in the strong
coupling regime. A partial density of states is defined encoding a generalized
nesting property of the band structure; variations in this density of states
account for differences between the dynamical cluster approximation and the
cellular-DMFT implementations of cluster DMFT, and for differences in behavior
between the single band models appropriate for cuprates and the multiband
models appropriate for manganites. A pole or strong resonance in the self
energy is associated with insulating states; the momentum dependence of the
pole is found to distinguish between Slater-like and Mott-like mechanisms for
metal insulator transition. Implications for the theoretical treatment of doped

orientated; the jets do not appear to be orthogonal to large-scale filaments or
even to the small-scale cores. Moreover, H2 jet lengths and opening angles are
not obviously correlated with indicators of outflow source age - source
spectral index or (sub)millimetre core flux. We demonstrate that H2 jet sources
are predominantly protostellar with flat or positive spectral indices, rather
than disk-excess (or T Tauri) stars. Most protostars in molecular cores drive
H2 outflows. However, not all molecular cores are associated with protostars or
H2 jets. On statistical grounds, the H2 jet phase may be marginally shorter
than the protostellar phase, though must be considerably shorter than the
prestellar phase. In terms of their spectral index, H2 jet sources are
indistinguishable from protostars. The few true protostars without H2 jets are
almost certainly more evolved than their H2-jet-driving counterparts. We also
find that protostars that power molecular outflows are no more (nor no less)
clustered than protostars that do not. The H2 emission regions in outflows from
young stars clearly weaken and fade very quickly, before the source evolves
from protostar to pre-main-sequence star.

structure of the Milky Way external disc as seen in 2MASS data, and in
particular the warp. Methods. We use the Two Micron All Sky Survey (hereafter
2MASS) along with the Stellar Population Synthesis Model of the Galaxy,
developed in Besancon, to constrain the external disc parameters such as its
scale length, its cutoff radius, and the slope of the warp. In order to
properly interpret the observations, the simulated stars are reddened using a
three dimensional extinction map. The shape of the stellar warp is then
compared with previous results and with similar structures in gas and dust.
Results. We find new constraints on the stellar disc, which is shown to be
asymmetrical, similar to observations of HI. The positive longitude side is
found to be easily modelled with a S shape warp but with a slope significantly
smaller than the slope seen in the HI warp. At negative longitudes, the disc
presents peculiarities which are not well reproduced by any simple model.
Finally, comparing with the warp seen in the dust, it seems to follow a slope
intermediate between the gas and the stars.

been on the case where the densities of the observations change at the same
instant at all the sensors due to the disruption. In this work, a more general
scenario is considered where the change propagates across the sensors, and its
propagation can be modeled as a Markov process. A centralized, Bayesian version
of this problem, with a fusion center that has perfect information about the
observations and a priori knowledge of the statistics of the change process, is
considered. The problem of minimizing the average detection delay subject to
false alarm constraints is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP). Insights into the structure of the optimal stopping rule are
presented. In the limiting case of rare disruptions, we show that the structure
of the optimal test reduces to thresholding the a posteriori probability of the
hypothesis that no change has happened. We establish the asymptotic optimality
(in the vanishing false alarm probability regime) of this threshold test under
a certain condition on the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between the post-
and the pre-change densities. In the special case of near-instantaneous change
propagation across the sensors, this condition reduces to the mild condition
that the K-L divergence be positive. Numerical studies show that this low

period of the system slowly changes though we are unable to discriminate
between several possible explanations of this trend. The best fit solution of
the continuum light curve reveals a contact configuration with the secondary
star being significantly brighter and hotter on its leading side facing the
primary. The mean temperature of the secondary star turns out to be only
slightly lower than that of the primary, whilst the bolometric luminosity ratio
is found to be 3.1. The solution of the light curve yields a distance of 925
+/- 25 pc much lower than the usually assumed distance of the Cyg OB2
association. Whilst we confirm the existence of episodes of higher X-ray
fluxes, the data reveal no phase-locked modulation with the 6.6 day period of
the eclipsing binary nor any clear relation between the X-ray flux and the 6.7
yr radio cycle. The bright region of the secondary star is probably heated by
energy transfer in a common envelope in this contact binary system as well as
by the collision with the primary's wind. The existence of a common photosphere
probably also explains the odd mass-luminosity relation of the stars in this

of Cyg OB2 #5 is likely to arise from the interaction of the combined wind of

considered. Pseudospin representation for an effective Hamiltonian is derived.
The system in equilibrium displays two phases, ordered and disordered. The
second-order phase transition between the phases can be driven either by
temperature or by changing the system parameters. Collective pseudospin
excitations have a gap disappearing at the phase-transition point. Dynamics of
atoms is studied, when they are loaded into the lattice in an initially
nonequilibrium state. It is shown that the temporal evolution of atoms,
contrary to their equilibrium thermodynamics, cannot be described in the
mean-field approximation, since it results in a structurally unstable dynamical
system, but a more accurate description is necessary taking account of
attenuation effects.

obtained improved effective temperature measurements of 27900 +/- 400 K and
26200 +/- 500 K, for the primary and secondary stars respectively, by fitting
non-LTE theoretical line profiles to the hydrogen Balmer lines. Armed with
these high-precision effective temperatures and the accurately known surface
gravities of the stars we have obtained the abundances of helium and metallic
elements. A detailed abundance analysis of the primary star shows a normal
(solar) helium abundance if the microturbulence velocity derived from metallic
lines is used. The elemental abundances show no indication that CNO-processed
material is present in the photosphere of this high-mass terminal age main
sequence star. The elemental abundances of the secondary star were derived by
differential study against a template spectrum of a star with similar
characteristics. Both the primary and secondary components display elemental
abundances which are in the ranges observed in the Galactic OB stars.

through homoclinic bifurcation in the presence of an infinite number of loops

photon statistics, non-negligible background and comparatively poor angular
resolution. Quantifying the significance of spatial features remains difficult.
Besides, spectrum extraction requires regions with large statistics while maps
in energy bands allow only qualitative interpretation. The two main competing
mechanisms in the VHE domain are the Inverse-Compton emission from accelerated
electrons radiating through synchrotron in the X-ray domain and the
interactions between accelerated hadrons and the surrounding medium, leading to
the production and subsequent decay of Pi0 mesons. The spectrum of the VHE
emission from leptons is predicted to steepen with increasing distance from the
acceleration zone, owing to synchrotron losses (i.e. cooled population). It
would remain approximately constant for hadrons. Ideally, spectro-imaging
analysis would have the same spatial scale in the TeV and X-ray domains, to
distinguish the local emission mechanisms. More realistically, we investigate
here the possibility of improving upon the currently published HESS results by
using more sophisticated tools.

comparison to the traditional MERT we do not expand the total cross-section in
the series of the incident momentum \hbar k, but instead we apply the exact
analytical solutions of the Schroedinger equation for the long-range
polarization potential, as proposed in the original formulation of O'Malley et
al. This extends the applicability of MERT up to few eV regime, as we confirm
using some simplified model potential of the electron-molecule interaction. The
parameters of the effective-range expansion (i.e. the scattering length and the
effective range) are determined from experimental, integral elastic cross
sections in the 0.1 - 1.0 eV energy range by fitting procedure. Surprisingly,
our treatment predicts a shape resonance that appears slightly higher than
experimentally well known resonance in the total cross section. Agreement with
the experimentally observed shape-resonance can be improved by assuming the
position of the resonance in a given partial wave. Influence of the quadrupole
potential on resonances is also discussed: we show that it can be disregarded
for N2. In conclusion, the modified-effective range formalism treating the
long-range part of the potential in an exact way, reproduces well both the very
low-energy behavior of the integral cross section as well as the presence of
resonances in the few eV range.

Z2^{(aux)} in the original model, to D4 x Z5. An additional difference is the
absence of right-handed neutrinos. Despite these changes the model is the same
as the GL model, since theta_{23} maximal and theta_{13}=0 arise through the
same mismatch of D4 subgroups, D2 in the charged lepton and Z2 in the neutrino

show that their vacuum structure, which leads to the prediction of theta_{13}
and theta_{23}, is a natural result of the scalar potential. We find that the
neutrino mass matrix only allows for inverted hierarchy, if we assume a certain
form of spontaneous CP violation. The quantity |m_{ee}|, measured in
neutrinoless double beta decay, is nearly equal to the lightest neutrino mass
m3. The Majorana phases phi1 and phi2 are restricted to a certain range for m3
< 0.06 eV. We discuss the next-to-leading order corrections which give rise to
shifts in the vacuum expectation values of the flavons. These induce deviations
from maximal atmospheric mixing and vanishing theta_{13}. It turns out that
these deviations are smaller for theta_{23} than for theta_{13}.

by tree level Z boson exchanges governed by right-handed couplings to down-type
quarks. Imposing all existing constraints from Delta F=2 transitions analysed
by us recently and fitting all quark masses and CKM mixing parameters we find
that a number of branching ratios for rare K decays can differ significantly
from the SM predictions, while the corresponding effects in rare B decays are
modest, dominantly due to the custodial protection being more effective in B
decays than in K decays. In order to reduce the parameter dependence we study
correlations between various observables within the K system, within the B
system and in particular between K and B systems, and also between Delta F=2
and Delta F=1 observables. These correlations allow for a clear distinction
between this new physics scenario and models with minimal flavour violation or
the Littlest Higgs Model with T-parity, and could give an opportunity to future
experiments to confirm or rule out the model. We show how our results would
change if the custodial protection of Z d_L^i bar d^j_L couplings was absent.

walls from both below and above. In this system, the interfacial instability is
induced by lateral vapor pressure fluctuation, which is in turn attributed to
the effect of phase change: evaporation occurs at a hotter portion of the
interface and condensation at a colder one. The high vapor pressure pushes the
interface downward and the low one pulls it upward. A set of equations
describing the temporal evolution of the interface of the liquid-vapor layers
is derived. This model neglects the effect of mass loss or gain at the
interface and guarantees the mass conservation of the liquid layer. The result
of linear stability analysis of the model shows that the presence of the
pressure dependence of the local saturation temperature mitigates the growth of
long-wave disturbances. The thinner vapor layer enhances the vapor pressure
effect. We find the stability criterion, which suggests that only slight
temperature gradients are sufficient to overcome the gravitational effect for a
water/vapor system. The same holds for the Rayleigh-Taylor unstable case, with
a possibility that the vapor pressure effect may be weakened if the
accommodation coefficient is below a certain critical value.

modulation of the order parameter results from the competition between a
short-ranged interaction and a long-ranged interaction decaying with some power
$\alpha$ of the inverse distance. With L being a spatial length characterizing
the modulated phase, all thermodynamic quantities are predicted to scale like
some power of L. The scaling dimensions with respect to L only depend on the
dimensionality of the system d and the exponent \alpha. Scaling predictions are
in agreement with experiments on ultra-thin ferromagnetic films and
computational results. Finally, our scaling hypothesis implies that, for some
range of values \alpha>d, Inverse-Symmetry-Breaking transitions may appear
systematically in the considered class of frustrated systems.

Experiments showed without much theoretical guidance that InAs/GaAs quantum
dots (QDs) may be tuned to such wavelengths by adjusting the In fraction in an
InxGa1-xAs strain-reducing capping layer (SRCL). In this work systematic
multimillion atom electronic structure calculations qualitatively and
quantitatively explain for the first time available experimental data. The NEMO
3-D simulations treat strain in a 15 million atom system and electronic
structure in a subset of ~9 million atoms using the experimentally given
nominal geometries and without any further parameter adjustments the
simulations match the nonlinear behavior of experimental data very closely.
With the match to experimental data and the availability of internal model
quantities significant insight can be gained through mapping to reduced order
models and their relative importance. We can also demonstrate that starting
from simple models has in the past led to the wrong conclusions. The critical
new insight presented here is that the QD changes its shape. The quantitative
simulation agreement with experiment without any material or geometry parameter
adjustment in a general atomistic tool leads us to believe that the era of nano
Technology Computer Aided Design (nano-TCAD) is approaching. NEMO 3-D will be
released on nanoHUB.org where the community can duplicate and expand on the
results presented here through interactive simulations.

quantum dynamical semigroups, we give a description of the continuous-variable
entanglement for a system consisting of two independent harmonic oscillators
interacting with a general environment. Using Peres-Simon necessary and
sufficient criterion for separability of two-mode Gaussian states, we describe
the generation and evolution of entanglement in terms of the covariance matrix
for an arbitrary Gaussian input state. For some values of diffusion and
dissipation coefficients describing the environment, the state keeps for all
times its initial type: separable or entangled. In other cases, entanglement
generation or entanglement collapse (entanglement sudden death) take place or
even a periodic collapse and revival of entanglement. We show that for certain
classes of environments the initial state evolves asymptotically to an
entangled equilibrium bipartite state, while for other values of the
coefficients describing the environment, the asymptotic state is separable. We
calculate also the logarithmic negativity characterizing the degree of
entanglement of the asymptotic state.

optical-cavity modes are coupled to one acoustic mode through radiation
pressure. Due to the optimal frequency matching -- the frequency separation of
two cavity modes is equal to the acoustic-mode frequency -- the carrier and
sideband fields simultaneously resonate and coherently build up. This mechanism
significantly enhances the optoacoustic couplings in the quantum regime. It
allows exploration of quantum behavior of optoacoustic interactions in
small-scale table-top experiments. We show explicitly that given an
experimentally achievable parameter, three-mode scheme can realize quantum
ground-state cooling of milligram scale mechanical oscillators and create
robust stationary tripartite optoacoustic quantum entanglements.

transitions in molecules constitutes a cornerstone of quantum physics, as
epitomized by the Franck-Condon principle of spectroscopy. Recent advances in
building molecular-electronics devices and nanoelectromechanical systems open a
new arena for studying the interaction between mechanical and electronic
degrees of freedom in transport at the single-molecule level. The tunneling of
electrons through molecules or suspended quantum dots has been shown to excite
vibrational modes, or vibrons. Beyond this effect, theory predicts that strong
electron-vibron coupling dramatically suppresses the current flow at low
biases, a collective behaviour known as Franck-Condon blockade. Here we show
measurements on quantum dots formed in suspended single-wall carbon nanotubes
revealing a remarkably large electron-vibron coupling and, due to the high
quality and unprecedented tunability of our samples, admit a quantitative
analysis of vibron-mediated electronic transport in the regime of strong
electron-vibron coupling. This allows us to unambiguously demonstrate the
Franck-Condon blockade in a suspended nanostructure. The large observed
electron-vibron coupling could ultimately be a key ingredient for the detection
of quantized mechanical motion. It also emphasizes the unique potential for
nanoelectromechanical device applications based on suspended graphene sheets
and carbon nanotubes.
