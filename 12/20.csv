true coarse-grained phase-space density distribution f(x,v) in equal-mass
mergers between dark matter (DM) halos. The halo models are constructed with
various asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cusps to core-like
profiles and we employ the phase-space density estimator ``Enbid'' developed by
Sharma & Steinmetz to compute f(x,v). The adopted force resolution allows
robust phase-space density profile estimates in the inner ~1% of the virial
radii of the simulated systems. We confirm that mergers result in a decrease of
the coarse-grained phase-space density in accordance with expectations from
Mixing Theorems for collisionless systems. We demonstrate that binary mergers
between identical DM halos produce remnants that retain excellent memories of
the inner slopes and overall shapes of the phase-space density distribution of
their progenitors. The robustness of the phase-space density profiles holds for
a range of orbital energies, and a variety of encounter configurations
including sequences of several consecutive merger events, designed to mimic
hierarchical merging, and collisions occurring at different cosmological
epochs. If the progenitor halos are constructed with appreciably different
asymptotic power-law indices, we find that the inner slope and overall shape of
the phase-space density distribution of the remnant are substantially closer to
that of the initial system with the steepest central density cusp. These
results explicitly demonstrate that mixing is incomplete in equal-mass mergers
between DM halos, as it does not erase memory of the progenitor properties. Our
results also confirm the recent analytical predictions of Dehnen (2005)
regarding the preservation of merging self-gravitating central density cusps.

signature change events. This suggests that it is time to revisit the sometimes
controversial topic of signature change in general relativity. Specifically, we
shall focus on the behaviour of a quantum field subjected to a manifold
containing regions of different signature. We emphasise that, regardless of the
underlying classical theory, there are severe problems associated with any
quantum field theory residing on a signature-changing background. (Such as the
production of what is naively an infinite number of particles, with an infinite
energy density.) From the viewpoint of quantum gravity phenomenology, we
discuss possible consequences of an effective Lorentz symmetry breaking scale.
To more fully understand the physics of quantum fields exposed to finite
regions of Euclidean-signature (Riemannian) geometry, we show its similarities
with the quantum barrier penetration problem, and the super-Hubble horizon
modes encountered in cosmology. Finally we raise the question as to whether
signature change transitions could be fully understood and dynamically
generated within (modified) classical general relativity, or whether they
require the knowledge of a full theory of quantum gravity.

and higher to diverge at the brane position, much as does the Coulomb potential
at the position of its source charge. This complicates finding the relation
between brane properties and the bulk geometries they source. (These
complications do not arise for codimension-1 sources, such as in RS geometries,
because of the special properties unique to codimension one.) Understanding
these relations is a prerequisite for phenomenological applications involving
higher-codimension branes. Using codimension-2 branes in extra-dimensional
scalar-tensor theories as an example, we identify the classical matching
conditions that relate the near-brane asymptotic behaviour of bulk fields to
the low-energy effective actions describing how space-filling codimension-2
branes interact with the surrounding extra-dimensional bulk. We do so by
carefully regulating the near-brane divergences, and show how these may be
renormalized in a general way. Among the interesting consequences is a
constraint relating the on-brane curvature to its action, that is the
codimension-2 generalization of the well-known modification of the Friedmann
equation for codimension-1 branes. We argue that its interpretation within an
effective field theory framework in this case is as a relation $4\pi U \simeq
\kappa^2 (T')^2$ between the codimension-2 brane tension, T, and its
contribution to the low-energy on-brane effective potential, U. This relation
implies that any dynamics that minimizes a brane contribution to the on-brane
curvature automatically also minimizes its couplings to the extra-dimensional
scalar.

of a spin-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAF), the so-called
$J_{1}$--$J_{2}'$ model, defined on an anisotropic 2D lattice. With respect to
an underlying square-lattice geometry the model contains antiferromagnetic
($J_{1} > 0$) bonds between nearest neighbors and competing ($J_{2}'>0$) bonds
between next-nearest neighbors across only one of the diagonals of each square
plaquette, the same diagonal in every square. Considered on an equivalent
triangular-lattice geometry the model may be regarded as having two sorts of
nearest-neighbor bonds, with $J_{2}' \equiv \kappa J_{1}$ bonds along parallel
chains and $J_{1}$ bonds providing an interchain coupling. Hence, the model
interpolates between a spin-half HAF on the square lattice at one extreme
($\kappa = 0$) and a set of decoupled spin-half chains at the other ($\kappa
\to \infty$), with the spin-half HAF on the triangular lattice in between at
$\kappa = 1$. We find strong evidence that quantum fluctuations favor a
first-order transition from quasiclassical N\'{e}el order to a quantum helical
state at a first critical point at $\kappa_{c_{1}} = 0.80 \pm 0.01$, by
contrast with the corresponding second-order transition between the equivalent
classical states at $\kappa_{{\rm cl}} = 0.5$. We also find strong evidence for
a second critical point at $\kappa_{c_{2}} = 1.8 \pm 0.4$ where another
first-order transition occurs, this time from the quantum helical phase to a
collinear stripe-ordered phase. This latter result provides quantitative
verification of a recent qualitative prediction of Starykh and Balents [Phys.\

X-ray diffuse background (SXRB) emission detected in front of 378 identified
shadowing regions during the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (Snowden et al. 2000). This
foreground component is principally attributed to the hot gas of the so-called
Local Bubble (LB), an irregularly shaped cavity of ~50-150 pc around the Sun,
which is supposed to contain ~10^6 K plasma. Our results suggest that the SWCX
emission from the heliosphere is bright enough to account for most of the
foreground emission towards the majority of low galactic latitude directions,
where the LB is the least extended. In a large part of directions with galactic
latitude above 30deg the heliospheric SWCX intensity is significantly smaller
than the measured one. However, the SWCX R2/R1 band ratio differs slightly from
the data in the galactic center direction, and more significantly in the
galactic anti-centre direction where the observed ratio is the smallest.
Assuming that both SWCX and hot gas emission are present and their relative
contributions vary with direction, we tested a series of thermal plasma spectra
for temperatures ranging from 10^5 to 10^6.5 K and searched for a combination
of SWCX spectra and thermal emission matching the observed intensities and band
ratios, while simultaneously being compatible with O VI emission measurements.
In the frame of collisional equilibrium models and for solar abundances, the
range we derive for hot gas temperature and emission measure cannot reproduce
the Wisconsin C/B band ratio. We emphasize the need for additional atomic data,
describing consistently EUV and X-ray photon spectra of the charge-exchange

Methods. We first obtain the Mount Wilson index S from the IUE high and
low-resolution spectra. Secondly, we analyse with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram
the mean annual index S and the amplitude of its rotational modulation.
Results. For HD 22468 (V711 Tau, HR 1099), we found a possible chromospheric
cycle with a period of 18 years and a shorter cycle with a period of 3 years,
which could be associated to a chromospheric ""flip-flop"" cycle. The data of HD
224085 (II Peg) also suggest a chromospheric cycle of 21 years and a flip-flop
cycle of 9 years. Finally, we obtained a possible chromospheric cycle of 7

the training method performs best in the intermediate redshift bins where there

photometric redshifts, the 1-sigma scatters ranging from 0.057 to 0.097 if
averaged over the entire redshift range. We also perform tests to check whether

occurring randomly with a given probability. Quantum ensembles are necessary to
describe situations with incomplete a priori information, such as the output of
a stochastic quantum channel (generalized measurement), and play a central role
in quantum communication. In this paper, we propose measures of distance and
fidelity between two quantum ensembles. We consider two approaches: the first
one is based on the ability to mimic one ensemble given the other one as a
resource and is closely related to the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transportation
problem, while the second one uses the idea of extended-Hilbert-space (EHS)
representations which introduce auxiliary pointer (or flag) states. Both types
of measures enjoy a number of desirable properties. The Kantorovich measures,
albeit monotonic under deterministic quantum operations, are not monotonic
under generalized measurements. In contrast, the EHS measures are. We present
operational interpretations for both types of measures. We also show that the
EHS fidelity between ensembles provides a novel interpretation of the fidelity
between mixed states--the latter is equal to the maximum of the fidelity
between all pure-state ensembles whose averages are equal to the mixed states
being compared. We finally use the new measures to define distance and fidelity
for stochastic quantum channels and positive operator-valued measures (POVMs).
These quantities may be useful in the context of tomography of stochastic
quantum channels and quantum detectors.

via his telescope, were a direct indication of distance -- fainter stars
(appearing smaller in the telescope) were farther away than brighter ones.
Galileo argued in his Dialogue that telescopic observation of a chance
alignment of a faint (distant) and bright (closer) star would reveal annual
parallax, if such double stars could be found. This would provide support both
for Galileo's ideas concerning the nature of stars and for the motion of the
Earth. However, Galileo actually made observations of such double stars, well
before publication of the Dialogue. We show that the results of these
observations, and the likely results of observations of any double star that
was a viable subject for Galileo's telescope, would undermine Galileo's ideas,
not support them. We argue that such observations would lead either to the more
correct conclusion that stars were sun-like bodies of varying sizes which could
be physically grouped, or to the less correct conclusion that stars are not
sun-like bodies, and even to the idea that the Earth did not move. Lastly, we
contrast these conclusions to those reached through applying Galileo's ideas to
observations of visible stars as a whole.

definite predictions for the LHC. For type I seesaw models with a TeV scale Z'
coupled to SM neutrinos, we find that for a normal neutrino mass hierarchy, at
least one of the right-handed neutrinos must be `electrophobic', decaying with
a strong preference into final states with muons and tauons rather than
electrons. For inverted or quasi-degenerate mass patterns, on the other hand,
we find upper bounds on the mass of at least one right-handed neutrino. In
particular, for an inverted mass hierarchy, this bound is 1 TeV, while the
corresponding upper limit in the quasi-degenerate case is 300 GeV. Similar
results hold in type III seesaw models, albeit with somewhat more stringent
bounds. For the Type II seesaw case with a weak scale SU(2) triplet Higgs, we
again find that an interesting range of Higgs triplet masses is disallowed by
these considerations.

description of the pion-pion interaction in the entire kinematically allowed

beyond the $S$-wave. For the $P$-wave, dominated by the $\rho(770)^0$, we use a
Breit-Wigner description. Higher waves are accounted for by using the usual

achievement is a good reproduction of the experimental $m_{\pi\pi}^2$

RU Lup was detected at 7 mm. It was observed at 16 mm 3 times and at 3 and 6 cm
4 times and found to be variable in all 3 wavebands. CS Cha was detected at 7
mm, but the S/N was too low to resolve the gap in the circumbinary disk. The
emission at 3, 7 and 16 mm for WW Cha is well explained by thermal emission
from mm and cm-sized pebbles. The cm spectral index is consistent with the
emission from an optically-thick ionised wind, but the high variability of the
cm emission points to a non-thermal contribution. The SEDs of RU Lup and CS Cha
from 1 to 7 mm are consistent with thermal emission from mm-sized grains. The
variability of the longer-wavelength emission for RU Lup and the negative

best calculated total atomization energies agree surprisingly well with 1991

small singlet-triplet splitting in C$_2$ requires inclusion of connected
quintuple and sextuple excitations. Post-CCSD(T) correlation effects in C$_4$
stabilize the linear form. Linear/cyclic equilibria in C$_6$, C$_8$, and
C$_{10}$ are not strongly affected by connected quadruples, but they are
affected by higher-order triples, which favor polyacetylenic rings but disfavor
cumulenic ones. Near the CCSD(T) basis set limit, C$_{10}$ does undergo bond
angle alternation in the bottom-of-the-well structure, although it is expected
to be absent in the vibrationally averaged structure. The thermochemistry of
these systems, and particularly the longer linear chains, is a particularly
difficult test for density functional methods. Particularly for the smaller
chains and the rings, double-hybrid functionals clearly outperform convential
DFT functionals for these systems. Among compound thermochemistry schemes, G4
clearly outperforms the other members of the G$n$ family. Our best estimates
for total atomization energies at 0 K should be reliable to 1 kJ/mol up to

bijel: bicontinuous interfacially-jammed emulsion gel. It is a
colloid-stabilized emulsion with fluid-bicontinuous domains. The potential to
create these gels was first predicted using computer simulations.
Experimentally we use mixtures of water and 2,6-lutidine at the composition for
which the system undergoes a critical demixing transition on warming. Colloidal
silica, with appropriate surface chemistry, is dispersed while the system is in
the single-fluid phase; the composite sample is then slowly warmed well beyond
the critical temperature. The liquids phase separate via spinodal decomposition
and the particles become swept up on the newly created interfaces. As the
domains coarsen the interfacial area decreases and the particles eventually
become jammed together. The resulting structures have a significant yield
stress and are stable for many months. Here we begin to explore the complex
wetting properties of fluorescently-tagged silica surfaces in water-lutidine
mixtures, showing how they can be tuned to allow bijel creation. Additionally
we demonstrate how the particle properties change with time while they are

case where the volume is controlled by two moduli, this condition simplifies
and turns out to be fully characterised by the intersection numbers of the

models where the superpotential takes a realistic form allowed by flux
backgrounds and gaugino condensation effects, for which a viable vacuum arises
without the need of invoking corrections to the Kahler potential breaking the

enzyme is only produced in the on switch state and the switching rate depends
linearly on the copy number of the enzyme. This work generalises the model of

We present a complete analytical solution for the steady-state statistics of
the number of enzyme molecules in the on and off states, for the general case
where the enzyme can mediate flipping in either direction. For this general
case we also solve for the flip time distribution, making a connection to first
passage and persistence problems in statistical physics. We show that the
statistics of the model are non-Poissonian, leading to a peak in the flip time
distribution. The occurrence of such a peak is analysed as a function of the
parameter space. We present a new relation between the flip time distributions
measured for two relevant choices of initial condition. We also introduce a new
correlation measure to show that this model can exhibit long-lived temporal
correlations, thus providing a primitive form of cellular memory. Motivated by

emissivity that has an excellent morphological correlation with the radio
continuum emission. The HII region is partially bordered by a photodissociation
region, which, in turn, is encircled by a molecular structure. Taking into
account the presence of noncircular motions in the Perseus spiral arm, together
with previous distance estimates for the region, we adopt a distance of 2.5 +-
0.5 kpc for Sh2-173. Seven hot stars were identified in the field of Sh2-173,
being only one an O-type star. The amount of energetic photons emitted by this
star is enough to keep the region ionized and heat the dust. Given that an
expanding HII region may trigger star formation, a search for YSO candidates
was made using different infrared point source catalogues. A population of 46
YSO candidates was identified projected onto the molecular clouds. On the other
hand, Sh2-173 is located in a dense edge of a large HI shell. The possibility
for Sh2-173 of being part of a hierarchical system of three generations is

and compared. We concluded that Sh2-173 is a young HII region of about 0.6 -
1.0 Myr old. As for the large shell we obtained a dynamical age of 5 +- 1 Myr.
These age estimates, together with the relative location of the different

to obtain a neutralino LSP it is often necessary to have tachyonic input Higgs
soft masses that can give rise to charge-and-color-breaking (CCB) minima and
unbounded-from-below (UFB) directions in the low energy theory. We investigate
the vacuum structure in these theories to determine when such problematic

we compute its lifetime under vacuum tunneling. We find that vacuum
metastability leads to severe restrictions on the parameter space for larger
$\tan\beta \sim 30$, while for smaller $\tan\beta\sim 10$, only minor
restrictions are found. Along the way, we derive an exact bounce solution for
tunneling through an inverted parabolic potential.

Increasing H lengthens the relaxation time by x500 from <200 ns to >100 ?s, and
it couples strongly the polarization relaxation and spin relaxations. The

Lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor in turbulent flows,
Chevillard & Meneveau (Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 174501, 2006) introduced the Recent
Fluid Deformation closure. Using matrix exponentials, the closure allows to
overcome the unphysical finite-time blow-up of the well-known Restricted Euler
model. However, it also requires the specification of a decorrelation time
scale of the velocity gradient along the Lagrangian evolution, and when the
latter is chosen too short (or, equivalently, the Reynolds number is too high),
the model leads to unphysical statistics. In the present paper, we explore the
limitations of this closure by means of numerical experiments and analytical
considerations. We also study the possible effects of using time-correlated
stochastic forcing instead of the previously employed white-noise forcing.
Numerical experiments show that reducing the correlation time scale specified
in the closure and in the forcing does not lead to a commensurate reduction of
the autocorrelation time scale of the predicted evolution of the velocity
gradient tensor. This observed inconsistency could explain the unrealistic
predictions at increasing Reynolds numbers.We perform a series expansion of the
matrix exponentials in powers of the decorrelation time scale, and we compare
the full original model with a linearized version. The latter is not able to
extend the limits of applicability of the former but allows the model to be
cast in terms of a damping term whose sign gives additional information about
the stability of the model as function of the second invariant of the velocity
gradient tensor.

rhombohedral structure of bulk LCO. However, the unit-cell volume of the
pseudo-tetragonal structure is found to be nearly constant over a very large

by the PAMELA and ATIC collaborations in terms of dark matter (DM) annihilation
has attracted considerable attention. Models surviving bounds from, e.g,
antiproton production generally fall into two classes, where either DM
annihilates directly with a large branching fraction into light leptons, or, as
in the recent models of Arkani-Hamed et al., and of Nomura and Thaler, the
annihilation gives low-mass (pseudo)scalars or vectors $\phi$ which then decay
into $\mu^+\mu^-$ or $e^+e^-$. While the constraints on the first kind of
models have recently been treated by several authors, we study here
specifically models of the second type which rely on an efficient Sommerfeld
enhancement in order to obtain the necessary boost in the annihilation cross
section. We compute the photon flux generated by QED radiative corrections to
the decay of $\phi$ and show that this indeed gives a rather spectacular broad
peak in $E^2d\sigma/dE$, that for these extreme values of the cross section
violate gamma-ray observations of the Galactic center for DM density profiles
steeper than that of Navarro, Frenk and White. The most stringent constraint
comes from the comparison of the predicted synchrotron radiation in the central
part of the Galaxy with radio observations of Sgr A*. For the most commonly
adopted DM profiles, the models that provide a good fit to the PAMELA and ATIC
data are ruled out, unless there are physical processes that boost the local
anti-matter fluxes more than one order of magnitude, while not affecting the
gamma-ray or radio fluxes.

the dark energy and the cold dark matter (CDM) fluid. Such interactions give
rise to new features in cosmological structure growth, like an additional
long-range attractive force between CDM particles, or variations of the dark
matter particle mass with time. We have implemented these effects in the N-body
code GADGET-2 and present results of a series of high-resolution N-body
simulations where the dark energy component is directly interacting with the
cold dark matter. As a consequence of the new physics, CDM and baryon
distributions evolve differently both in the linear and in the nonlinear regime
of structure formation. Already on large scales a linear bias develops between
these two components, which is further enhanced by the nonlinear evolution. We
also find, in contrast with previous work, that the density profiles of CDM
halos are less concentrated in coupled dark energy cosmologies compared with
LCDM, and that this feature does not depend on the initial conditions setup,
but is a specific consequence of the extra physics induced by the coupling.
Also, the baryon fraction in halos in the coupled models is significantly
reduced below the universal baryon fraction. These features alleviate tensions
between observations and the LCDM model on small scales. Our methodology is
ideally suited to explore the predictions of coupled dark energy models in the
fully non-linear regime, which can provide powerful constraints for the viable
parameter space of such scenarios.

within a non-abelian gauge sector they are often unstable. We seek the fate of
this instability, focussing on the simplest examples: sphere-monopole
compactifications in six dimensions. Without gravity most non-abelian monopoles
are unstable, decaying into the unique stable monopole in the same topological
class. We show that the same is true in Einstein-YM systems, with the geometry
adjusting accordingly: a Mink(d)xS2 geometry supported by an unstable monopole
relaxes to an AdS(d)xS2. For 6D supergravity, the dilaton obstructs this simple
evolution, acquiring a gradient and thus breaking some of the spacetime
symmetries. We argue that it is the 4D symmetries that break, and examine
several endpoint candidates. Oxidising the supergravity system into a
higher-dimensional Einstein-YM monopole, we use the latter to guide us to the
corresponding endpoint. The result is a singular Kasner-like geometry conformal
to Mink(4)xS2. The solution has lower potential energy and is perturbatively
stable, making it a sensible candidate endpoint for the evolution. (Abridged

cosmic rays in the interstellar medium (ISM) focusing on the efficiency of
magnetic field amplification and the issue of energy equipartition between
magnetic, kinetic and cosmic ray (CR) energies. We perform numerical CR-MHD
simulations of the ISM using the extended version of ZEUS-3D code in the
shearing box approximation and taking into account the presence of Ohmic
resistivity, tidal forces and vertical disk gravity. CRs are supplied in
randomly distributed supernova (SN) remnants and are described by the
diffusion-advection equation, which incorporates an anisotropic diffusion
tensor. The azimuthal magnetic flux and total magnetic energy are amplified
depending on a particular choice of model parameters. We find that the most
favorable conditions for magnetic field amplification correspond to magnetic
diffusivity of the order of $3\times 10^{25} \cm^2\s^{-1}$, SN rates close to
those observed in the Milky Way, periodic SN activity corresponding to spiral
arms, and highly anisotropic and field-aligned CR diffusion. The rate of
magnetic field amplification is relatively insensitive to the magnitude of SN
rates in a rage of spanning 10% up to 100% of realistic values. The timescale
of magnetic field amplification in the most favorable conditions is 150 Myr, at
galactocentric radius equal to 5 kpc. The final magnetic field energies
fluctuate near equipartition with the gas kinetic energy. In all models CR
energy exceeds the equipartition values by a least an order of magnitude, in
contrary to the expected equipartition. We suggest that the excess of cosmic
rays can be attributed to the fact that the shearing-box does not permit cosmic
rays to leave the system along the horizontal magnetic field.

that incorporates directional motion and destabilization of the MT plus end by
kinesin 8. Our model quantitatively reproduces the key features of
length-vs-time traces for stabilized MTs in the presence of purified kinesin 8,
including length-dependent depolymerization. Comparison of model predictions
with experiments suggests that kinesin 8 depolymerizes processively, i.e., one
motor can remove multiple tubulin dimers from a stabilized MT. Fluctuations in
MT length as a function of time are related to depolymerization processivity.
We have also determined the parameter regime in which the rate of MT
depolymerization is length dependent: length-dependent depolymerization occurs
only when MTs are sufficiently short; this crossover is sensitive to the bulk

creation driven cosmological models are capable of accounting for the SNIa
observations of the recent transition from a decelerating to an accelerating
Universe. Here we test the evolution of such models at high redshift using the
constraint on z_eq, the redshift of the epoch of matter radiation equality,
provided by the WMAP constraints on the early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect.
Since the contribution of baryons and radiation was ignored in the work of LSS,
we include them in our study of this class of models. The parameters of these
more realistic models with continuous creation of CDM is tested and constrained
at widely-separated epochs (z = z_eq and z = 0) in the evolution of the

constraint on z_eq and that which follows from the low redshift SNIa data,
challenging the viability of this class of models.

temperature minerals in comets and the outer regions of protoplanetary disks
around other stars. Further, inward transport of solids from the outer regions
of the solar nebula has been postulated to be the manner in which short-lived
radionuclides were introduced to the terrestrial planet region and the cause of
the variations in oxygen isotope ratios seen in primitive materials. Here, both
outward and inward transport of solids are investigated in the context of a
two-dimensional, viscously evolving protoplanetary disk. The dynamics of solids
are investigated to determine how they depend on particle size and the
particular stage of protoplanetary disk evolution, corresponding to different
rates of mass transport. It is found that the outward flows that arise around
the disk midplane of a protoplanetary disk aid in the outward transport of
solids up to the size of CAIs and can increase the crystallinity fraction of
silicate dust at 10 AU around a solar mass star to as much as $\sim$40% in the
case of rapidly evolving disks, decreasing as the accretion rate onto the star
slows. High velocity, inward flows along the disk surface aid in the rapid
transport of solids from the outer disk to the inner disk, particularly for
small dust. Despite the diffusion that occurs throughout the disk, the
large-scale, meridonal flows associated with mass transport prevent complete
homogenization of the disk, allowing compositional gradients to develop that
vary in intensity for a timescale of one million years.

power and gravitational binding energy is released and then dissipated locally,
with the mass of its origin. This is equivalent to the Shakura-Sunyaev 1973
(SS73) prescription for the dissipation of accretion power and subsequent
conversion into radiate output. Since their seminal paper, broadband
observations of quasars and black hole X-ray binaries insist that the SS73
prescription cannot wholly describe their behavior. In particular, optically
thick black hole accretion flows are almost universally accompanied by coronae
whose relative power by far exceeds anything seen in studies of stellar
chromospheric and coronal activity. In this note, we briefly discuss the
possible repercussions of freeing accretion models of GRBs from the SS73
prescription. Our main conclusion is that the efficiency of converting
gravitational binding energy into a GRB power can be increased by an order of
magnitude or more.

large-scale asymmetry that may account for the non-spherical excitation and
substructure of spectral lines such as H$\alpha$ and He I 10830\AA. Jets with a
large fraction of kinetic to thermal energy punch through the progenitor
envelope and give rise to explosions that would be observed to be asymmetric
from the earliest epochs, inconsistent with spectropolarimetric measurements of
Type II supernovae. Jets with higher thermal energy fractions result in
explosions that are roughly spherical at large radii but are significantly
elongated at smaller radii, deep inside the ejecta, in agreement with the
polarimetric observations. We present shock breakout light curves that indicate
that strongly aspherical shock breakouts are incompatible with recent {\it
GALEX} observations of shock breakout from red supergiant stars. Comparison
with observations indicates that jets must deposit their kinetic energy
efficiently throughout the ejecta while in the hydrogen envelope. Thermal
energy-dominated jets satisfy this criterion and yield many of the

relied, to date, on the source having sufficient variability to allow
photometric variations from each path to be compared. However, the delay times
of many gravitational lenses cannot be measured because the intrinsic source
amplitude variations are too small to be detectable. At the fundamental quantum
mechanical level, such photometric time stamps allow which-path knowledge,
removing the ability to obtain an interference pattern. However, if the two
paths can be made equal (zero time delay) then interference can occur. We
describe an interferometric approach to measuring gravitational lens delay
times using a quantum-eraser/restorer approach, whereby the time travel along
the two paths may be rendered measurably equal. Energy and time being
non-commuting observables, constraints on the photon energy in the energy-time
uncertainty principle, via adjustments of the width of the radio bandpass,
dictate the uncertainty of the time delay and therefore whether the path taken
along one or the other gravitational lens geodesic is knowable. If one starts
with interference, for example, which-path information returns when the
bandpass is broadened (constraints on the energy are relaxed) to the point
where the uncertainty principle allows a knowledge of the arrival time to
better than the gravitational lens delay time itself, at which point the
interference will disappear. We discuss the near-term feasibility of such
measurements in light of current narrow-band radio detectors and known short
time-delay gravitational lenses.

phase referencing by simultaneous differential VLBI but mainly from a removal
of large phase change by subtracting an arbitrary fitted curve to the phase
variations.
  The differential phase of the observed H2O masers between W49 North (W49N)
and OH~43.8-0.1 did not show a sinusoidal variation with a period of one
sidereal day due to a positional offset from the real celestial positions. We
therefore could not reproduce the results in A2003 by a normal positional
correction estimated from all time data, but could reproduce almost the same
phases only for the first hour by adjusting parameters. Using the parameters,
we could not suppress the large amount of phase variations for the successive
time data that A2003 did not show in their paper.

showing the performance of the instrument for phase referencing, which should
be demonstrated by other experiments observing several pairs of continuum

fluctuations contained in vulcanization theory, associated with a subtle form
of spontaneous symmetry breaking that is associated with the
liquid-to-random-solid transition. The resulting free energy of this Goldstone
sector can be reinterpreted as arising from a phenomenological description of

the statistics of the quenched disorder of the elasticity of soft random
solids, in terms of residual stress and Lam\'e-coefficient fields. In

evidence that the expansion converges satisfactorily to third order in the
expansion, which we have computed analytically for s and d wave NN scattering.
Starting with the Kaplan-Savage-Wise (KSW) expansion about the nontrivial fixed
point corresponding to infinite NN scattering length, we cure the convergence
problems with that theory by summing to all orders the singular short distance

general edit distance. The problem of computing an edit distance between two
non-crossing arc-annotated sequences was introduced in \cite{Evans99}. The
introduced model uses edit operations that involve either single letters or
pairs of letters (never considered separately) and is solvable in
polynomial-time \cite{ZhangShasha:1989}. To account for other possible RNA
structural evolutionary events, new edit operations, allowing to consider
either silmutaneously or separately letters of a pair were introduced in
\cite{jiangli}; unfortunately at the cost of computational tractability. It has
been proved that comparing two RNA secondary structures using a full set of
biologically relevant edit operations is {\sf\bf NP}-complete. Nevertheless, in
\cite{DBLP:conf/spire/GuignonCH05}, the authors have used a strong
combinatorial restriction in order to compare two RNA stem-loops with a full

population based on observed relations between the black hole mass and the host

particular focus on black hole luminosities below the Eddington limit as
observed in many local AGN. For such luminosities, up to 20% of high-redshift
black holes can be active quasars. We then discuss the observables of
high-redshift black holes for ALMA and JWST by adopting NGC 1068 as a reference
system. We calculate the expected flux of different fine-structure lines for a
similar system at higher redshift, and provide further predictions for high-J
CO lines. We discuss the expected fluxes from stellar light, the AGN continuum
and the Lyman $\alpha$ line for JWST. Line fluxes observed with ALMA can be
used to derive detailed properties of high-redshift sources. We suggest two
observational strategies to find potential AGN at high redshift and estimate
the expected number of sources, which is between 1-10 for ALMA with a field of
view of $\sim(1')^2$ searching for line emission and 100-1000 for JWST with a
field of view of $(2.16')^2$ searching for continuum radiation. We find that
both telescopes can probe high-redshift quasars down to redshift 10 and beyond,

Tsallis, due to space-time foam is discussed within the context of a particular
kind of foam in string/brane-theory, the D-particle foam model . The latter
involves point-like brane defects (D-particles), which provide the
topologically non-trivial foamy structures of space-time. A stochastic Langevin
equation for the velocity recoil of D-particles can be derived from the pinched
approximation for a sum over genera in the calculation of the partition
function of a bosonic string in the presence of heavy D-particles. The string
coupling in standard perturbation theory is related to the exponential of the
expectation of the dilaton. Inclusion of fluctuations of the dilaton itself and
uncertainties in the string background will then necessitate fluctuations in
$g_{s}$. The fluctuation in the string coupling in the sum over genera
typically leads to a generic structure of the Langevin equation where the
coefficient of the noise term, dependent on the string coupling $g_{s}$,
fluctuates. The positivity of $g_{s}$ leads naturally to a stochastic modelling
of its distribution with a $\chi$- distribution. This then rigorously implies a
Tsallis type non-extensive or, more generally, a superstatistics distribution
for the recoil velocity of D-particles. As a concrete and physically
interesting application, we provide a rigorous estimate of an $\omega$-like
effect, pertinent to CPT violating modifications of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
correlators in entangled states of neutral Kaons. In the case of D-particle
foam fluctuations, which respect the Lorentz symmetry of the vacuum on average,
we find that the $\omega$-effect may be within the range of sensitivity of
future meson factories.

is related to the negative contribution of the rotation term to the energy

motion inherited by these vortices from this superflow, are explored in the
general setting of the superfluidity of helium-four in arbitrary dimensions.
The vortices may be idealized as objects of co-dimension two, such as
one-dimensional loops and two-dimensional closed surfaces, respectively, in the
cases of three- and four-dimensional superfluidity. By using the analogy
between vorticial superflow and Ampere-Maxwell magnetostatics, the equilibrium
superflow containing any specified collection of vortices is constructed. The
energy of the superflow is found to take on a simple form for vortices that are
smooth and asymptotically large, compared with the vortex core size. The motion
of vortices is analyzed in general, as well as for the special cases of
hyper-spherical and weakly distorted hyper-planar vortices. In all dimensions,
vortex motion reflects vortex geometry. In dimension four and higher, this
includes not only extrinsic but also intrinsic aspects of the vortex shape,
which enter via the first and second fundamental forms of classical geometry.
For hyper-spherical vortices, which generalize the vortex rings of three
dimensional superfluidity, the energy-momentum relation is determined. Simple
scaling arguments recover the essential features of these results, up to
numerical and logarithmic factors.

special case of conservative overdetermined time invariant 2D systems is
developed and studied. Defining transfer function of such a systems we obtain a
class CI of inner functions $S(\lambda,t_2)$, which are identity for
$\lambda=\infty$, satisfy certain regularity assumptions and intertwines
solutions of ODEs with a spectral parameter $\lambda$. Using translation model,
we prove that every function in the class CI can be realized as a transfer
function of a certain vessel.
  The highlight of this theory is a generalization Potapov's theorem, which
gives a very special formula for such a function in the form of multiplication
of Blacke-Potapov products, corresponding to the discrete spectrum of certain
system operator $A_1(t_2)$ and of multiplicative integral, corresponding to the
continuous spectrum of $A_1(t_2)$. This theorem is proved under a slightly more
restrictive assumptions, then the development of the whole theory. Namely, we
suppose that the derivative of the transfer function is a continuous function
of $t_2$ for almost all $\lambda$.

  estimation of a regression function",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a pioneer work, R\'ev\'esz (1973) introduces the stochastic approximation
method to build up a recursive kernel estimator of the regression function
$x\mapsto E(Y|X=x)$. However, according to R\'ev\'esz (1977), his estimator has
two main drawbacks: on the one hand, its convergence rate is smaller than that
of the nonrecursive Nadaraya-Watson's kernel regression estimator, and, on the
other hand, the required assumptions on the density of the random variable $X$
are stronger than those usually needed in the framework of regression
estimation. We first come back on the study of the convergence rate of
R\'ev\'esz's estimator. An approach in the proofs completely different from
that used in R\'ev\'esz (1977) allows us to show that R\'ev\'esz's recursive
estimator may reach the same optimal convergence rate as Nadaraya-Watson's
estimator, but the required assumptions on the density of $X$ remain stronger
than the usual ones, and this is inherent to the definition of R\'ev\'esz's
estimator. To overcome this drawback, we introduce the averaging principle of
stochastic approximation algorithms to construct the averaged R\'ev\'esz's
regression estimator, and give its asymptotic behaviour. Our assumptions on the
density of $X$ are then usual in the framework of regression estimation. We
prove that the averaged R\'ev\'esz's regression estimator may reach the same
optimal convergence rate as Nadaraya-Watson's estimator. Moreover, we show
that, according to the estimation by confidence intervals point of view, it is
better to use the averaged R\'ev\'esz's estimator rather than Nadaraya-Watson's
estimator.
