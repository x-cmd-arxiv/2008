We
classify possible models depending on the way the Higgs fields couple to the
supersymmetry breaking hidden-sector. The different types of models have
distinct signatures in the MSSM parameters. We find concrete and surprisingly
simple examples based on messengers in each class. These examples lead to all
the soft masses and a consistent Higgs-sector.

the system in two and three dimensions and analyze the phase structure in terms
of effective theories and duality arguments. For the two-dimensional case we
derive the effective potential both at zero and finite temperature. The
zero-temperature theory at the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point has a critical point
related to the self-dual point of a class of $Z_N$ models in the $N\to\infty$
limit. Two phase transitions featuring a fixed line are shown to appear in the
phase diagram, one at zero temperature and at the RK point and another one at
finite temperature above the RK point. The latter will be shown to correspond
to a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) phase transition, while the former will be
governed by a KT-like universality class, i.e., sharing many features with a KT
transition but actually corresponding to a different universality class. On the
other hand, we show that at the RK point no phase transition happens at finite
temperature. For the three-dimensional case we derive the corresponding dual
gauge theory model at the RK point. We show in this case that at zero
temperature a first-order phase transition occurs, while at finite temperatures
both first- and second-order phase transitions are possible, depending on the
relative values of the couplings involved.

really prove is that the cosmological expansion cannot be described in terms of
real motions in Minkowski spacetime. However, there is no controversy about
this issue. Abramowicz et al. show that in general, the cosmological redshift

of Equivalence it follows that there must be also a gravitational shift in

acceleration play a fundamental role in the theory of cosmic-ray acceleration.
Their existence usually requires that a fraction of the accelerated particles
be allowed to escape from the system. Because the scattering mean-free-path is
thought to be an increasing function of energy, this condition is
conventionally implemented as an upper cut-off in energy space -- particles are
then permitted to escape from any part of the system, once their energy exceeds
this limit. However, because accelerated particles are responsible for
substantial amplification of the ambient magnetic field in a region upstream of
the shock front, we examine an alternative approach in which particles escape
over a spatial boundary. We use a simple iterative scheme that constructs
stationary numerical solutions to the coupled kinetic and hydrodynamic
equations. For parameters appropriate for supernova remnants, we find
stationary solutions with efficient acceleration when the escape boundary is
placed at the point where growth and advection of strongly driven non-resonant
waves are in balance. We also present the energy dependence of the distribution

boundary of an accretion disc. Observations indicate that some of the
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the luminosities of accreting
compact objects (neutron stars, black holes and white dwarfs) are produced in
the inner-most regions of accretion discs or boundary layers. Two simple models
are considered in this paper: The magnetosphere-disc model consists of a thin
Keplerian disc in contact with a uniformly rotating magnetosphere with and low
plasma density, while the star-disc model involves a Keplerian disc terminated
at the stellar atomosphere with high density and small density scale height. We
find that the interface modes at the magnetosphere-disc boundary are generally
unstable due to Rayleigh-Taylor and/or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However,
differential rotation of the disc tends to suppress Rayleigh-Taylor instability
and a sufficiently high disc sound speed (or temperature) is needed to overcome
this suppression and to attain net mode growth. On the other hand,
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability may be active at low disc sound speeds. We also
find that the interface modes trapped at the boundary between a thin disc and
an unmagnetized star do not suffer Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability, but can become unstable due to wave leakage to large disc radii
and, for sufficiently steep disc density distributions, due to wave absorption
at the corotation resonance in the disc. The non-axisymmetric interface modes
studied in this paper may be relevant to the high-frequency QPOs observed in
some X-ray binaries and in cataclysmic variables.

characterize the essential role of the spontaneous emission rate in the

coupled atom-light states strictly depends on the ratio of the detuning and the
resonant Rabi frequency. The predicted time of thermalization is in the
nanosecond domain and about ten times shorter than the natural lifetime at full
optical power in our experiment. Experimentally we are investigating the
interaction of the optical field with rubidium atoms in an ultra-high pressure
buffer gas cell under the condition of large atom-field detuning comparable to
the thermal energy in frequency units. In particular, an observed detuning

description of stably stratified turbulent boundary layers with the important
example of the stable atmospheric boundary layer in mind is addressed.
Traditional approaches to this problem, based on the profiles of mean
quantities, velocity second-order correlations, and dimensional estimates of
the turbulent thermal flux run into a well known difficulty, predicting the
suppression of turbulence at a small critical value of the Richardson number,
in contradiction with observations. Phenomenological attempts to overcome this
problem suffer from various theoretical inconsistencies. Here we present an
approach taking into full account all the second-order statistics, which allows
us to respect the conservation of total mechanical energy. The analysis
culminates in an analytic solution of the profiles of all mean quantities and
all second-order correlations removing the unphysical predictions of previous
theories. We propose that the approach taken here is sufficient to describe the
lower parts of the atmospheric boundary layer, as long as the Richardson number
does not exceed an order of unity. For much higher Richardson numbers the
physics may change qualitatively, requiring careful consideration of the
potential Kelvin-Helmoholtz waves and their interaction with the vortical
turbulence.

four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. In fact, we give an analytical solution
representing circular magnetic monopole loops joining a pair of merons in the
four-dimensional Euclidean SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. This is achieved by solving
the differential equation for the adjoint color (magnetic monopole) field in
the two--meron background field within the recently developed reformulation of
the Yang-Mills theory. Our analytical solution corresponds to the numerical
solution found by Montero and Negele on a lattice. This result strongly
suggests that a meron pair is the most relevant quark confiner in the original
Yang-Mills theory, as Callan, Dashen and Gross suggested long ago.

evolution either in time (coherent particle production) or in space (quantum
reflection). Our central finding is that in systems with certain space-time
symmetries, quantum coherence manifests itself in the form of new spectral
solutions for the dynamical 2-point correlation function. This spectral
structure leads to a consistent approximation for dynamical equations that
describe coherent evolution in presence of decohering collisions. We illustrate
the method by solving the bosonic Klein problem and the bound states for the
nonrelativistic square well potential. We then compare our spectral phase space
definition of particle number to other definitions in the nonequilibrium field
theory. Finally we will explicitly compute the effects of interactions to
coherent particle production in the case of an unstable field coupled to an
oscillating background.

to determine key parameters used in approximate galactic mass models and to
understand Galactic structure and evolution. However, authors are often forced
to base dynamical analyses on potentially unreliable figures because recent
determinations of the LSR have failed to reach agreement, especially with
regard to the direction, V, of Galactic rotation. Aims. To explain why the
traditional method for calculating the LSR fails, and to find alternative means
of calculating the LSR with realistic error margins. Methods. We assemble and
investigate the kinematic properties of 20 574 stars within 300pc, with
complete and accurate kinematic data. The traditional method of calculating the
LSR assumes a well-mixed distribution. In fact, the velocity distribution is
highly structured, invalidating calculations based on mean motions and
asymmetric drift. We find other indicators in the distribution which we believe
give a better estimate of circular motion. Results. We find good agreement
between results and give as our best estimate of the LSR (U_0, V_0, W_0) = (7.5
+- 1.0, 13.5 +- 0.3, 6.8 +- 0.1) km/s. We calculate the slope of the circular
speed curve at the solar radius, finding -9.3 +- 0.9 km/s/kpc.

enough with respect to lateral heterogeneity of a medium, which is not always
the case in heavy charged particle radiotherapy. This work addresses a solution
for this problem by applying our discovery of self-similar nature of Gaussian
distributions. In this method, Gaussian beams split into narrower and
deflecting daughter beams when their size has exceeded the lateral
heterogeneity limit. They will be automatically arranged with modulated areal
density for accurate and efficient dose calculations. The effectiveness was
assessed in an carbon-ion beam experiment in presence of steep range
compensation, where the splitting calculation reproduced the detour effect of
imperfect compensation amounting up to about 10% or as large as the lateral
particle disequilibrium effect. The efficiency was analyzed in calculations for
carbon-ion and proton radiations with a heterogeneous phantom model, where the
splitting calculations took about a minute and were factor of 5 slower than the
non-splitting ones. The beam-splitting method is reasonably accurate,
efficient, and general so that it can be potentially used in various
pencil-beam algorithms.
