inertia and gravitation. Recalling the problem raised by vacuum field
fluctuations with respect to inertia and gravitation, we show that vacuum
energy differences, such as Casimir energy, do contribute to inertia. Mass
behaves as a quantum observable and in particular possesses quantum
fluctuations. We show that the compatibility of the quantum nature of mass with
gravitation can be ensured by conformal symmetries, which allow one to
formulate a quantum version of the equivalence principle. Finally, we consider
some corrections to the coupling between metric fields and energy-momentum
tensors induced by radiative corrections. Newton gravitation constant is
replaced by two different running coupling constants in the sectors of
traceless and traced tensors. There result metric extensions of general
relativity, which can be characterized by modified Ricci curvatures or by two
gravitation potentials. The corresponding phenomenological framework extends
the usual Parametrized Post-Newtonian one, with the ability to remain
compatible with classical tests of gravity while accounting for new features,
such as Pioneer like anomalies or anomalous light deflection.

without shear is studied using three-dimensional numerical simulations of
penetrative rotating compressible convection. We demonstrate that rotating
convection in a Cartesian domain can drive a large-scale dynamo even in the
absence of shear. The large-scale field contains a significant fraction of the
total field in the saturated state. The simulation results are compared with
one-dimensional mean-field dynamo models where turbulent transport
coefficients, as determined using the test field method, are used. The reason
for the absence of large-scale dynamo action in earlier studies is shown to be
due to the rotation being too slow: whereas the alpha-effect can change sign,
its magnitude stays approximately constant as a function of rotation, and the
turbulent diffusivity decreases monotonically with increasing rotation. Only
when rotation is rapid enough a large-scale dynamo can be excited. The
one-dimensional mean-field model with dynamo coefficients from the test field
results predicts reasonably well the dynamo excitation in the direct
simulations. This result further validates the test field procedure and
reinforces the interpretation that the observed dynamo is driven by a turbulent
alpha-effect. This result demonstrates the existence of an alpha-effect and an
alpha^2-dynamo with natural forcing.

extended the analysis with the inclusion of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, large scale

considered in the present paper. The bounds on the lifetime of decaying dark
matter are dominated by either the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect for
the scenario with weak reionization, or CMB polarization observations when
there is significant reionization. For the respective scenarios, the lifetimes
for decaying dark matter are $\Gamma^{-1} \gtrsim 100$ Gyr and $ (f \Gamma)
^{-1} \gtrsim 5.3 \times 10^8$ Gyr (at 95.4% confidence level), where the
phenomenological parameter $f$ is the fraction of the decay energy deposited in
baryonic gas. This allows us to constrain particle physics models with dark
matter candidates through investigation of dark matter decays into Standard
Model particles via effective operators. For decaying dark matter of $\sim 100$
GeV mass, we found that the size of the coupling constant in the effective
dimension-4 operators responsible for dark matter decay has to generically be $
\lesssim 10^{-22}$. We have also explored the implications of our analysis for
representative models in theories of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking,
minimal supergravity and little Higgs.

momentum dependence of the pion form factor is investigated up to values of the
squared four-momentum transfer Q**2 ~ 0.8 GeV**2 and, thanks to the use of
twisted boundary conditions, down to Q**2 ~ 0.05 GeV**2. Volume and
discretization effects on the form factor appear to be within the statistical
errors. Our results for the pion mass, decay constant and form factor are
analyzed using (continuum) Chiral Perturbation Theory at
next-to-next-to-leading order. The extrapolated value of the pion charge radius
is <r**2>{phys} = 0.456 +/- 0.030(stat.) +/- 0.024(syst.) in nice agreement
with the experimental result. The extrapolated values of the pion form factor
agree very well with the experimental data up to Q**2 ~ 0.8 GeV**2 within
uncertainties which become competitive with the experimental errors for Q**2 >
0.3 GeV**2. The relevant low-energy constants appearing in the chiral expansion
of the pion form factor are extracted from our lattice data, which come
essentially from a single lattice spacing, adding the experimental value of the
pion scalar radius in the fitting procedure. Our findings are in nice agreement
with the available results of ChPT analyses of pion-pion scattering data as
well as with other analyses of our collaboration.

dwarf nova. The observational campaign (completed in 2007) covers five
superoutbursts and four normal outbursts. We examined principal parameters of
the system to understand peculiarities of DI UMa, and other active cataclysmic
variables. Based on precise photometric measurements, temporal light curve
behaviour, O-C analysis, and power spectrum analysis, we investigated physical
parameters of the system. We found that the period of the supercycle now equals
31.45 +/-0.3 days. Observations during superoutbursts infer that the period of
superhumps equals P_sh = 0.055318(11) days (79.66 +/- 0.02 min). During
quiescence, the light curve reveals a modulation of period P_orb = 0.054579(6)
days (78.59 +/- 0.01 min), which we interpret as the orbital period of the
binary system. The values obtained allowed us to determine a fractional period
excess of 1.35% +/- 0.02%, which is surprisingly small compared to the usual
value for dwarf novae (2%-5%). A detailed O-C analysis was performed for two
superoutbursts with the most comprehensive coverage. In both cases, we detected
an increase in the superhump period with a mean rate of dot_P/P_sh =
4.4(1.0)*10^{-5}. Based on these measurements, we confirm that DI UMa is
probably a period bouncer, an old system that reached its period minimum a long
time ago, has a secondary that became a degenerate brown dwarf, the entire
system evolving now toward longer periods. DI UMa is an extremely interesting
object because we know only one more active ER UMa star with similar
characteristics (IX Dra).

region to encounter a grid. The atomic weight of the expansion gas controls the
beam velocity and hence the flight time from the interaction region to the

its longitudinal width as a function of flight time. Comparing these widths to
the width of the laser beam that defines the initial size of the illuminated
volume allows us to gauge the rate of expansion of the plasma. We find that the

of canonical loop quantum gravity. The construction of such models usually rely
on the Plebanski formulation of general relativity as a constrained BF theory
and is based on the discretization of the action on a simplicial triangulation,
which may be viewed as an ultraviolet regulator. The triangulation dependence
can be removed by means of group field theory techniques, which allows one to
sum over all triangulations. The main tasks for these models are the correct
quantum implementation of the Plebanski constraints, the existence of a
semiclassical sector implementing additional ""Regge-like"" constraints arising
from simplicial triangulations, and the definition of the physical inner
product of loop quantum gravity via group field theory. Here we propose a new
approach to tackle these issues stemming directly from the Holst action for
general relativity, which is also a proper starting point for canonical loop
quantum gravity. The discretization is performed by means of a ""cubulation"" of
the manifold rather than a triangulation. We give a direct interpretation of
the resulting spin foam model as a generating functional for the n-point
functions on the physical Hilbert space at finite regulator. This paper focuses
on ideas and tasks to be performed before the model can be taken seriously.
However, our analysis reveals some interesting features of this model: first,
the structure of its amplitudes differs from the standard spin foam models.
Second, the tetrad n-point functions admit a ""Wick-like"" structure. Third, the
restriction to simple representations does not automatically occur -- unless
one makes use of the time gauge, just as in the classical theory.

corresponding adjacency matrices is defined and then applied to investigate the
so called cobweb posets and their $Hasse$ digraphs called $KoDAGs$. $KoDAGs$
are special orderable directed acyclic graphs which are cover relation digraphs
of cobweb posets introduced by the author few years ago. $KoDAGs$ appear to be
distinguished family of $Ferrers$ digraphs which are natural join of a
corresponding ordering chain of one direction directed cliques called
$di-bicliques$. These digraphs serve to represent faithfully corresponding
relations of arbitrary arity so that all relations of arbitrary arity are their
subrelations. Being this $chain -way$ complete if compared with kompletne
$Kuratowski$ bipartite graphs their $DAG$ denotation is accompanied with the
letter $K$ in front of descriptive abbreviation $oDAG$. The way to join
bipartite digraphs of binary into $multi-ary$ relations is the natural join
operation either on relations or their digraph representatives. This natural
join operation is denoted here by $\os$ symbol deliberately referring to the
direct sum $\oplus$ of adjacency matrices as it becomes the case for disjoint
$di-bigraphs$.

same model of a dimer of two exchange-coupled spins used in [2] as a basis to
extend the study of the influence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction
on the quantum tunneling of the magnetization of this system; in particular,
they show that a tilt of the DM vector away from the uniaxial anisotropy axis
can account for the asymmetric nature of the quantum interference minima
associated with resonances between states of opposite parity, e.g., k = 1(A).
We want to stress that the inclusion of DM interactions in a system with
inversion symmetry cannot mix states of opposite parity; i.e., the parity
operator commutes with the Hamiltonian. Consequently, the use by Wernsdorfer et
al. of a single DM vector in a centrosymmetric dimer is strictly forbidden
since it implicitly violates parity conservation. The authors correctly point
out that the lack of an inversion center between each pair of manganese ions on
the wheel justifies the possibility of local DM interactions, even though the
complete molecule has an inversion center. However, these local DM interactions
must also satisfy the molecular inversion symmetry; i.e., they cannot mix
states of opposite parity.We agree that such DM interactions are not always
completely innocuous; e.g., they can mix spin states having the same parity.
Indeed, in kagome systems [3] (cited in [1]), this can lead to weak
ferromagnetism. Nevertheless, the inversion symmetry of the lattice is
preserved and parity is still conserved.

heuristics coarsens the graph by iteratively merging clusters (starting from
singletons), and optionally refines the resulting clustering by iteratively
moving individual vertices between clusters. Several heuristics of this type

  This paper experimentally compares existing and new coarsening- and

the most widely used criterion for merging clusters (modularity increase) is
outperformed by other simple criteria, and that a recent algorithm by Schuetz
and Caflisch is no improvement over simple greedy coarsening for these
criteria. Concerning refinement, a new multi-level algorithm is shown to
produce significantly better clusterings than conventional single-level
algorithms. A comparison with published benchmark results and algorithm
implementations shows that combinations of coarsening and multi-level
refinement are competitive with the best algorithms in the literature.

far, how to detect these quantum phases and phase transitions effectively
remains an outstanding challenge. In this paper, we will develop a systematic
and unified theory of using the optical Bragg scattering, atomic Bragg
scattering or cavity QED to detect the ground state and the excitation spectrum
of many quantum phases of interacting bosons loaded in bipartite and frustrated
optical lattices.
  We show that the two photon Raman transition processes in the three detection
methods not only couple to the density order parameter, but also the {\sl
valence bond order} parameter due to the hopping of the bosons on the lattice.
This valence bond order coupling is very sensitive to any superfluid order or
any Valence bond (VB) order in the quantum phases to be probed. These quantum
phases include not only the well known superfluid and Mott insulating phases,
but also other important phases such as various kinds of charge density waves
(CDW), valence bond solids (VBS), CDW-VBS phases with both CDW and VBS orders
unique to frustrated lattices, and also various kinds of supersolids.
  The physical measurable quantities of the three experiments are the light
scattering cross sections, the atom scattered clouds and the cavity leaking
photons respectively. We analyze respectively the experimental conditions of
the three detection methods to probe these various quantum phases and their
corresponding excitation spectra. We also address the effects of a finite

formation, we explore the relationship between star formation process and the
associated feedback, by investigating how the mechanical feedback from
supernovae(SNe) and radiative feedback from luminous objects regulate the star
formation rate and therefore affect the cosmic reionization.Based on our
present knowledge of the negative feedback theory and some numerical
simulations, we construct an analytic model in the framework of the Lambda cold
dark matter model. In certain parameter regions, our model can explain some
observational results properly. In large halos(T_vir>10000 K), both mechanical
and radiative feedback have a similar behavior: the relative strength of
negative feedback reduces as the redshift decreases. In contrast, in small
halos (T_vir<10000 K$) that are thought to breed the first stars at early time,
the radiative feedback gets stronger when the redshift decreases. And the star
formation rate in these small halos depends very weakly on the star-formation
efficiency. Our results show that the radiative feedback is important for the
early generation stars. It can suppress the star formation rate considerably.
But the mechanical feedback from the SNe explosions is not able to affect the
early star formation significantly. The early star formation in small-halo
objects is likely to be self-regulated. The radiative and mechanical feedback
dominates the star formation rate of the PopII/I stars all along. The feedback
from first generation stars is very strong and should not be neglected.
However, their effects on the cosmic reionization are not significant, which

periodic scalar and dyadic Green's functions of the Helmholtz equation for 2D
and 3D configurations with a 1D (linear) periodicity. The presented schemes
work seamlessly for any observation location near the array and for any
practical array periodicities, including electrically small and large
periodicities. The representations are based on the expansion of the periodic
Green's functions in terms of the continuous spectral integrals over the
transverse (to the array) spectral parameters. To achieve high convergence and
numerical efficiency, the introduced integral representations are cast in a
hybrid form in terms of (i) a small number of contributions due to sources
located around the unit cell of interest, (ii) a small number of symmetric
combinations of the Floquet modes, and (iii) an integral evaluated along the
steepest descent path (SDP). The SDP integral is regularized by extracting the
singular behavior near the saddle point of the integrand and integrating the
extracted components in closed form. Efficient quadrature rules are established
to evaluate this integral using a small number of quadrature nodes with
arbitrary small error for a wide range of structure parameters. Strengths of
the introduced approach are demonstrated via extensive numerical examples.

the asymmetric periodic Anderson model within the dynamical mean field
framework. The lattice coherence scale $\om_L$, which is proportional within
the LMA to the spin-flip energy scale, and has been shown in earlier studies to
be the energy scale at which crossover to single impurity physics
occurs,increases monotonically with increasing magnetic field. The many body
Kondo resonance in the density of states at the Fermi level splits into two
with the splitting being proportional to the field itself. For h$\geq$ 0, we
demonstrate adiabatic continuity from the strongly interacting case to a
corresponding non-interacting limit, thus establishing Fermi liquid behaviour
for heavy fermion metals in the presence of magnetic field. In the Kondo
lattice regime, the theoretically computed magnetoresistance is found to be
negative in the entire temperature range. We argue that such a result could be
understood at $T\gtrsim \om_L$ by field-induced suppression of spin-flip
scattering and at $T\lesssim \om_L$ through lattice coherence. The coherence
peak in the heavy fermion resistivity diminishes and moves to higher
temperatures with increasing field. Direct comparison of the theoretical
results to the field dependent resistivity measurements in CeB$_6$ yields good

quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at two critical values, Hc1 and Hc2, of the
magnetic field. There are now known examples of strongly coupled (rung exchange
interaction much stronger than nearest-neighbour intrachain exchange
interaction) organic ladder compounds in which QPTs have been experimentally
observed. In this paper, we investigate whether well-known bipartite
entanglement meaures like one-site von Neumann entropy, two-site von Neumann
entropy and concurrence develop special features close to the quantum critical
points. As suggested by an earlier theorem, the first derivatives of the
measures with respect to magnetic field are expected to diverge as H tends to
Hc1 and Hc2. Based on numerical diagonalization data and a mapping of the
strongly-coupled ladder Hamiltonian onto the XXZ chain Hamiltonian, for which
several analytical results are known, we find that the derivatives of the
entanglement measures diverge as H tends to Hc2 but remain finite as H tend to
Hc1. The reason for this discrepancy is analysed. We further calculate two
recently proposed quantum information theoretic measures, the reduced fidelity
and reduced fidelity susceptibility, and show that these measures provide
appropriate signatures of the QPTs occuring at the critical points H=Hc1 and
H=Hc2.

good approximations for modestly sized finite populations. The extension to

thin graphene wire. We develop an effective field theory (EFT) based on an
expansion in p/p_T, where p_T is the typical momentum of electrons and holes in
the transverse direction, while p are the momenta in the longitudinal
direction. We show that, to the lowest-order in (p/p_T), our EFT theory is
formally equivalent to the exactly solvable Schwinger model. By exploiting such
an analogy, we find that the ground state of the quantum wire contains a
condensate of electron-hole pairs. The excitation spectrum is saturated by
electron-hole collective bound-states, and we calculate the dispersion law of
such modes. We also compute the DC conductivity per unit length at zero
chemical potential and find g_s =e^2/h, where g_s=4 is the degeneracy factor.

compensation of acceptors by donors makes it possible to change independently
the concentration of holes n and the total concentration of charged impurities
N. We propose a theory of the superconductor-insulator phase diagram in the

coupling superconductivity, where Cooper pairs are compact, non-overlapping
bosons. For compact Cooper pairs the transition occurs at a significantly
higher density than in the case of spatially overlapping pairs. We establish
the superconductor-insulator phase diagram by studying how the potential of
randomly positioned charged impurities is screened by holes or by strongly
bound Cooper pairs, both in isotropic and layered superconductors. In the
resulting self-consistent potential the carriers are either delocalized or
localized, which corresponds to the superconducting or insulating phase,

measurements in the mid-plane perpendicular to the span axis of the foil are
used to characterize the different flow regimes. The deflection angle of the
mean jet flow with respect to the horizontal observed in the average velocity
field is used as a measure of the asymmetry of the vortex street. Time series
of the vorticity field are used to calculate the advection velocity of the
vortices with respect to the free-stream, defined as the phase velocity
$U_{phase}$, as well as the circulation $\Gamma$ of each vortex and the spacing
$\xi$ between consecutive vortices in the near wake. The observation that the
symmetry breaking results from the formation of a dipolar structure from each
couple of counter-rotating vortices shed on each flapping period serves as
starting point to build a model for the symmetry breaking threshold. A symmetry
breaking criterion based on the relation between the phase velocity of the
vortex street and an idealized self-advection velocity of two consecutive
counter-rotating vortices in the near wake is established. The predicted
threshold for symmetry breaking accounts well for the deflected wake regimes
observed in the present experiments and may be useful to explain other

classes of isolated neutron stars (INSs) which are radio-quiet or exhibit radio
emission with properties much at variance with those of ordinary radio pulsars.
The identification of new sources is crucial in order to understand the
relations among the different classes and to compare observational constraints
with theoretical expectations. A recent analysis of the 2XMMp catalogue
provided less than 30 new thermally emitting INS candidates. Among these, the
source 2XMM J104608.7-594306 appears particularly interesting because of the
softness of its X-ray spectrum and of the present upper limits in the optical,
which imply a logarithmic X-ray-to-optical flux ratio greater than 3.1,
corrected for absorption. We present the X-ray and optical properties of 2XMM
J104608.7-594306 and discuss its nature in the light of two possible scenarios
invoked to explain the X-ray thermal emission from INSs: the release of
residual heat in a cooling neutron star, as in the seven radio-quiet
ROSAT-discovered INSs, and accretion from the interstellar medium. We find that
the present observational picture of 2XMM J104608.7-594306 is consistent with a
distant cooling INS with properties in agreement with the most up-to-date
expectations of population synthesis models: it is fainter, hotter and more
absorbed than the seven ROSAT sources and possibly located in the Carina
Nebula, a region likely to harbour unidentified cooling neutron stars. The
accretion scenario, although not entirely ruled out by observations, would
require a very slow (~10 km/s) INS accreting at the Bondi-Hoyle rate.

  pricing measure and the role of correlation after the subprime crisis","Updated version accepted for publication in Mathematical Finance",,,,"q-fin.CP q-fin.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we consider three problems of the standard market approach to
pricing of credit index options: the definition of the index spread is not
valid in general, the usually considered payoff leads to a pricing which is not
always defined, and the candidate numeraire one would use to define a pricing
measure is not strictly positive, which would lead to a non-equivalent pricing
measure.
  We give a general mathematical solution to the three problems, based on a
novel way of modeling the flow of information through the definition of a new
subfiltration. Using this subfiltration, we take into account consistently the
possibility of default of all names in the portfolio, that is neglected in the
standard market approach. We show that, while the related mispricing can be
negligible for standard options in normal market conditions, it can become
highly relevant for different options or in stressed market conditions.
  In particular, we show on 2007 market data that after the subprime credit
crisis the mispricing of the market formula compared to the no arbitrage
formula we propose has become financially relevant even for the liquid

us to derive effective interface evolution equations (IEE) in which parameters

form of the linear dispersion relation of the IEE changes drastically for slow

form of the well-known (noisy) Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, showing a
morphological instability at short times that evolves into kinetic roughening

combines Mullins-Sekerka linear dispersion relation with a KPZ nonlinearity,

optimization problem based on Conway's game of life. It is a prime example of
weighted constrained optimization problem that has been recently tackled in the

technique commonly used to solve this kind of constraint satisfaction problem.
When the memory required to apply BE is too high, a heuristic method based on
it (denominated mini-buckets) can be used to calculate bounds for the optimal

unpractical for large size problems. In response to this situation, we present
a memetic algorithm for the MDSLP in which BE is used as a mechanism for
recombining solutions, providing the best possible child from the parental set.
Subsequently, a multi-level model in which this exact/metaheuristic hybrid is
further hybridized with branch-and-bound techniques and mini-buckets is
studied. Extensive experimental results analyze the performance of these models

optimal patterns for up to date solved instances in less time than current

  Results: We discovered six double mode pulsators, with the first overtone and
a secondary mode of higher frequency simultaneously excited. These are the
first double mode RR Lyr stars identified in Omega Cen. In variable V10 period
ratio of the two modes is 0.80, which corresponds to pulsations in the first

anisotropic (dTc/dpa = 3.1(1) K/GPa and dTc/dpc = - 7.0(2) K/GPa). Our results
show that there is a strong coupling of the c/a ratio to superconducting order,
which demonstrates that Tc is far from the optimal value. A surprising
similarity with the uniaxial pressure effects in several other layered

dissipative embedding map of $2-d$ area-preserving standard map which models
the incompressible flow. The system is a model for impurity dynamics in a fluid
and is characterized by two parameters, the inertia parameter $\alpha$, and the
dissipation parameter $\gamma$. We obtain the statistical characterisers of
transport for this system in these dynamical regimes. These are, the recurrence
time statistics, the diffusion constant, and the distribution of jump lengths.
The recurrence time distribution shows a power law tail in the dynamical
regimes where there is preferential concentration of particles in sticky
regions of the phase space, and an exponential decay in mixing regimes. The
diffusion constant shows behaviour of three types - normal, subdiffusive and
superdiffusive, depending on the parameter regimes. Phase diagrams of the
system are constructed to differentiate different types of diffusion behaviour,
as well as the behaviour of the absolute drift. We correlate the dynamical
regimes seen for the system at different parameter values with the transport
properties observed at these regimes, and in the behaviour of the transients.
This system also shows the existence of a crisis and unstable dimension
variability at certain parameter values. The signature of the unstable
dimension variability is seen in the statistical characterisers of transport.
We discuss the implications of our results for realistic systems.

proposed by Georgi, where a new physics sector becomes conformal and provides
""unparticle"" which couples to the Standard Model sector through higher
dimensional operators in low energy effective theory. Among several
possibilities, we focus on operators involving the (scalar) unparticle, Higgs
and the gauge bosons. Once the Higgs develops the vacuum expectation value
(VEV), the conformal symmetry is broken and as a result, the mixing between the
unparticle and the Higgs boson emerges. In this paper, we consider a natural
realization of bosonic seesaw in the context of unparticle physics. In this
framework, the negative mass squared or the electroweak symmetry breaking
vacuum is achieved as a result of mass matrix diagonalization. In the
diagonalization process, it is important to have zero value in the
(1,1)-element of the mass matrix. In fact, the conformal invariance in the
hidden sector can actually assure the zero of that element. So, the bosonic
seesaw mechanism for the electroweak symmetry breaking can naturally be
understood in the framework of unparticle physics.

considered in second-order perturbation theory, starting from the unperturbed
helical motion of the particles. The calculations are done with the help of an
improved binary collisions treatment which is valid for any strength of the
magnetic field, where the second-order energy and velocity transfers are
represented in Fourier space for arbitrary interaction potentials. The energy
transfer is explicitly calculated for a regularized and screened potential
which is both of finite range and non-singular at the origin, and which
involves as limiting cases the Debye (i.e., screened) and Coulomb potential.
Two distinct cases are considered in detail. (i) The collision of two identical
(e.g., electron-electron) particles; (ii) and the collision between a
magnetized electron and an uniformly moving heavy ion. The energy transfer
involves all harmonics of the electron cyclotron motion. The validity of the
perturbation treatment is evaluated by comparing with classical trajectory
Monte--Carlo calculations which also allows to investigate the strong
collisions with large energy and velocity transfer at low velocities. For large
initial velocities on the other hand, only small velocity transfers occur.
There the non-perturbative numerical classical trajectory Monte--Carlo results
agree excellently with the predictions of the perturbative treatment.

attackers} and {\it defenders} are self-interested entities. We assume a {\it
reward-sharing} scheme among {\it interdependent} defenders; each defender
wishes to (locally) maximize her own total {\it fair share} to the attackers
extinguished due to her involvement (and possibly due to those of others). What
is the {\em maximum} amount of protection achievable by a number of such
defenders against a number of attackers while the system is in a {\it Nash
equilibrium}? As a measure of system protection, we adopt the {\it
Defense-Ratio} \cite{MPPS05a}, which provides the expected (inverse) proportion
of attackers caught by the defenders. In a {\it Defense-Optimal} Nash
equilibrium, the Defense-Ratio is optimized.
  We discover that the possibility of optimizing the Defense-Ratio (in a Nash
equilibrium) depends in a subtle way on how the number of defenders compares to
two natural graph-theoretic thresholds we identify. In this vein, we obtain,
through a combinatorial analysis of Nash equilibria, a collection of trade-off
results:
  - When the number of defenders is either sufficiently small or sufficiently
large, there are cases where the Defense-Ratio can be optimized. The
optimization problem is computationally tractable for a large number of
defenders; the problem becomes ${\cal NP}$-complete for a small number of
defenders and the intractability is inherited from a previously unconsidered
combinatorial problem in {\em Fractional Graph Theory}.
  - Perhaps paradoxically, there is a middle range of values for the number of
defenders where optimizing the Defense-Ratio is never possible.

for a typical source (a 10 solar mass compact object captured by a one million
solar mass SMBH at signal to noise ratio of 30) we expect to determine the two
masses to within a fractional error of ~0.0001, measure the spin parameter q to
~0.00003 and determine the location of the source on the sky and the spin
orientation to within 0.001 steradians. We show that, for this kludge model,
omitting the conservative corrections leads to a small error over much of the
parameter space, i.e., the ratio R of the theoretical model error to the Fisher
Matrix error is R<1 for all ten parameters in the model. For the few systems
with larger errors typically R<3 and hence the conservative corrections can be
marginally ignored. In addition, we use our model and first order self-force

features of a time series representing a risk factor. This tutorial aims to
introduce a number of different stochastic processes that can help in grasping
the essential features of risk factors describing different asset classes or
behaviors. This paper does not aim at being exhaustive, but gives examples and
a feeling for practically implementable models allowing for stylised features
in the data. The reader may also use these models as building blocks to build
more complex models, although for a number of risk management applications the
models developed here suffice for the first step in the quantitative analysis.
The broad qualitative features addressed here are {fat tails} and {mean
reversion}. We give some orientation on the initial choice of a suitable
stochastic process and then explain how the process parameters can be estimated
based on historical data. Once the process has been calibrated, typically
through maximum likelihood estimation, one may simulate the risk factor and
build future scenarios for the risky portfolio. On the terminal simulated
distribution of the portfolio one may then single out several risk measures,

simulation of the risk factors Finally, this first survey report focuses on
single time series. Correlation or more generally dependence across risk

high-resolution echelle spectrograph. The cumulated exposure time on the star
was 44 hrs, corresponding to 255 individual high-resolution echelle spectra

spectrum representing the effective photospheric absorption profile modified by
pulsations. Difference spectra were calculated by subtracting rotationally
broadened artificial profiles; these residual spectra were analysed and
non-radial pulsations were detected. A subsequent analysis with two
complementary methods, namely Fourier Parameter Fit (FPF) and Fourier 2D (F2D)
has been performed and first constraints on the pulsation modes have been

can be interpreted as evidence for coronal currents, with values as large as
$2.5 \times 10^9$ Amperes (Spangler 2007). These estimates of currents are used
to develop a model for Joule heating in the corona. It is assumed that the
currents are concentrated in thin current sheets, as suggested by theories of
two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The Spitzer result for the
resistivity is adopted as a lower limit to the true resistivity. The calculated
volumetric heating rate is compared with an independent theoretical estimate by
Cranmer et al (2007). This latter estimate accounts for the dynamic and
thermodynamic properties of the corona at a heliocentric distance of several
solar radii. Our calculated Joule heating rate is less than the Cranmer et al
estimate by at least a factor of $3 \times 10^5$. The currents inferred from
the observations of Spangler (2007) are not relevant to coronal heating unless
the true resistivity is enormously increased relative to the Spitzer value.
However, the same model for turbulent current sheets used to calculate the
heating rate also gives an electron drift speed which can be comparable to the
electron thermal speed, and larger than the ion acoustic speed. It is therefore
possible that the coronal current sheets are unstable to current-driven
instabilities which produce high levels of waves, enhance the resistivity and
thus the heating rate.

Dynamical Systems in Thermodynamic Formalism Theory. It has the advantage of
been very easy to be introduced. It is basically obtained from transfer
operators (also called Ruelle operators). Later we introduce the concept of
pressure as a min-max principle.
  Finally, we consider the concept of a KMS state as an equilibrium state for a
potential (in the context of $C^*$-Algebras) and we show that there is a
relation between KMS states for certain algebras coming from a continuous
transformation and equilibrium measures.
