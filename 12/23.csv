overall experimental observations, with the IED process itself being built
directly on three experimental facts, a) electric charges present with all
material particles, b) an accelerated charge generates electromagnetic waves
according to Maxwell's equations and Planck energy equation and c) source
motion produces Doppler effect. A set of well-known basic particle equations
and properties become predictable based on first principles solutions for the
IED process; several key solutions achieved are outlined, including the de
Broglie phase wave, de Broglie relations, Schr\""odinger equation, mass,
Einstein mass-energy relation, Newton's law of gravity, single particle self
interference, and electromagnetic radiation and absorption; these equations and
properties have long been broadly experimentally validated or demonstrated. A
specific solution also predicts the Doebner-Goldin equation which emerges to
represent a form of long-sought quantum wave equation including gravity. A
critical review of the key experiments is given which suggests that the IED
process underlies the basic particle equations and properties not just
sufficiently but also necessarily.

oscillate with the magnetic flux with a period of hc/2e. This is indeed true
for s-wave superconductors larger than the coherence length xi_0. Here we show
that for superconductors with gap nodes, there is no such strict condition for
the supercurrent to be hc/2e rather than hc/e periodic. For nodal
superconductors, the flux induced Doppler shift of the near nodal states leads
to a flux dependent occupation probability of quasi-particles circulating
clockwise and counter clockwise around the loop, which leads to an hc/e
periodic component of the supercurrent, even at zero temperature. We analyze
this phenomenon on a cylinder in an approximative analytic approach and also
numerically within the framework of the BCS theory. Specifically for d-wave
pairing, we show that the hc/e periodic current component decreases with the
inverse radius of the loop and investigate its temperature dependence.

interaction between the domain wall and the spin waves appears when there is a
finite difference between the domain wall velocity $\dot{x}_0$ and the spin

Firstly, spin-wave emission leads to a Landau-type damping of the
current-induced domain wall motion towards restoring the solution $\dot{x}_0 =
u$, where spin angular momentum is perfectly transfered from the conduction
electrons to the domain wall. Secondly, the interaction leads to a modification
of the domain wall width and mass, proportional to the kinetic energy of the
domain wall. Thirdly, the coupling by the electrical current between the domain
wall and the spin waves leads to temperature-dependent effective wall mass.

a ten thousand or more times of scattering, which corresponds to the order of
10^3 yrs for neutral hydrogen density of the concordance \Lambda CDM model. The
time evolution of the shape and width of the local Boltzmann distribution
actually doesn't dependent on the details of atomic recoil, photon sources, or
initial conditions very much. However, the intensity of photon flux at the
local Boltzmann distribution is substantially time-dependent. The time scale of
approaching the saturated intensity can be as long as 10^5-10^6 yrs for typical
parameters of the \Lambda CDM model. The intensity of the local Boltzmann
distribution at time less than 10^5 yrs is significantly lower than that of the
saturation state. Therefore, it may not be always reasonable to assume that the
deviation of the spin temperature of 21 cm energy states from cosmic background
temperature is mainly due to the W-F coupling if first stars or their
emission/absorption regions evolved with a time scale equal to or less than
Myrs.

regions without any assumption regarding the properties of the dusty component.
The anti-correlation arises from the simple cancelation of the polarization
vectors along the line of sight. This effect is amplified within denser regions
as the magnetic field configuration becomes more complex. We studied the
probability distribution, the power spectrum and the structure function of the
polarization angles. These statistical analysis revealed strong defferences

to provide a picture as wide and complete as possible of the problem of
measuring the distance of microquasars in our Galaxy. The purpose of this work
is to fairly and critically review in great detail every distance method used
for these two microquasars in order to show that the distances of probably all
microquasars in our galaxy are much more uncertain than currently admitted.
Moreover, we show that many confirmations of quantitative results are often
entangled and rely on very uncertain measurements. We also present a new
determination of the maximum distance of GRO J1655-40 using red clump giant
stars, and show that it confirms our earlier result of a distance less than 2
kpc instead of 3.2 kpc. Since it then becomes more likely that GRO J1655-40
could originate from the stellar cluster NGC 6242, located at 1.0 kpc, we
review the distance estimations of A0620-00, which is so far the closest black
hole with an average distance of about 1.0 kpc. We show that the distance
methods used for A0620-00 are also problematic. Finally, we present a new
analysis of spectroscopic and astrometric archival data on this microquasar,
and apply the maximum-distance method of Foellmi et al. (2006). It appears that
A0620-00 could indeed be even closer to the Sun than currently estimated, and
consequently would be the closest known black hole to the Sun.

relations between the statistical properties of the node tags and those of the

we introduce a number of new notions, including tag-assortativity (relating
link probability to node similarity), and new quantities, such as node
uniqueness (measuring how rarely the tags of a node occur in the network) and
tag-assortativity exponent. We apply our approach to three large networks
representing very different domains of complex systems. A number of the tag
related quantities display analogous behaviour (e.g., the networks we studied
are tag-assortative, indicating possible universal aspects of tags versus
topology), while some other features, such as the distribution of the node
uniqueness, show variability from network to network allowing for pin-pointing
large scale specific features of real-world complex networks. We also find that
for each network the topology and the tag distribution are scale invariant, and
this self-similar property of the networks can be well characterised by the
tag-assortativity exponent, which is specific to each system.

well as endogenous and exogenous stress-related agents. In addition, during
development global patterns of gene transcription change dramatically, and
these changes are associated with altered patterns of DNA replication. In
metazoan embryos, for example, transcription is repressed globally and any
sequence in the genome can serve as a site for the start of DNA synthesis. As
transcription is activated and a G1 phase imposed, the pattern of replication
adapts to these changes by restricting the sites where DNA synthesis begins.
Recent evidence indicates that each unit of replication, or replicon, is
specified by two or more potential replication origins, but only one is
selected to initiate replication of the replicon. How the cell distinguishes
between potential origins, and how it selects a given origin of replication
remain unclear. This raises important questions concerning the nature and
definition of the eukaryotic replicon. In the following we will review emerging
evidence concerning the mechanisms involved in regulating replication origins

cavity is considered by taking a ""permuted"" charge distribution on the chain so
that the ""adsorbed"" counterions are allowed to move along the backbone. We
compute the degree of ionization by using self-consistent field theory (SCFT)
and compare with the previously developed variational theory. Analysis of
various contributions to the free energy in both theories reveals that the
equilibrium degree of ionization is attained mainly as an interplay of the
adsorption energy of counterions on the backbone, the translational entropy of
the small ions, and their correlated density fluctuations. Degree of ionization
computed from SCFT is significantly lower than that from the variational
formalism. The difference is entirely due to the density fluctuations of the
small ions in the system, which are accounted for in the variational procedure.
When these fluctuations are deliberately suppressed in the truncated
variational procedure, there emerges a remarkable quantitative agreement in the
various contributing factors to the equilibrium degree of ionization, in spite
of the fundamental differences in the approximations and computational
procedures used in these two schemes. Nevertheless, since the significant
effects from density fluctuations of small ions are not captured by the SCFT,
and due to the close agreement between SCFT and the other contributing factors
in the more transparent variational procedure, the latter is a better
computational tool for obtaining the degree of ionization.

self-gravitating particles in one spatial dimension provides a simple toy model
for the analogous three dimensional problem. We focus here on a limitation of
such models as treated so far in the literature: the force, as it has been
specified, is well defined in infinite point distributions only if there is a
centre of symmetry (i.e. the definition requires explicitly the breaking of
statistical translational invariance). The problem arises because naive
background subtraction (due to expansion, or by ""Jeans' swindle"" for the static
case), applied as in three dimensions, leaves an unregulated contribution to
the force due to surface mass fluctuations. Following a discussion by
Kiessling, we show that the problem may be resolved by defining the force in
infinite point distributions as the limit of an exponentially screened pair
interaction. We show that this prescription gives a well defined (finite) force
acting on particles in a class of perturbed infinite lattices, which are the
point processes relevant to cosmological N-body simulations. For identical
particles the dynamics of the simplest toy model is equivalent to that of an
infinite set of points with inverted harmonic oscillator potentials which
bounce elastically when they collide. We discuss previous results in the
literature, and present new results for the specific case of this simplest
(static) model starting from ""shuffled lattice"" initial conditions. These show
qualitative properties (notably its ""self-similarity"") of the evolution very
similar to those in the analogous simulations in three dimensions, which in
turn resemble those in the expanding universe.

method, we numerically study the spin dynamics and transport in one-dimensional
spin-1/2 systems at zero temperature. Instead of computing transport
coefficients from linear response theory, we study the real-time evolution of
the magnetization starting from spatially inhomogeneous initial states. In
particular, we are able to analyze systems far away from equilibrium with this
set-up. By computing the time-dependence of the variance of the magnetization,
we can distinguish diffusive from ballistic regimes, depending on model
parameters. For the example of the anisotropic spin-1/2 chain and at half
filling, we find the expected ballistic behavior in the easy-plane phase, while
in the massive regime the dynamics of the magnetization is diffusive. Our
approach allows us to tune the deviation of the initial state from the ground
state and the qualitative behavior of the dynamics turns out to be valid even
for highly perturbed initial states in the case of easy-plane exchange
anisotropies. We further cover two examples of nonintegrable models, the
frustrated chain and the two-leg spin ladder, and we encounter diffusive

linear form whose stabilizer for the coadjoint representation, modulo the
center, is a reductive Lie algebra with a center consisting of semisimple
elements. Parabolic subalgebras of a semisimple Lie algebra are not always
quasi-reductive (except in types A or C by work of Panyushev). The
classification of quasi-reductive parabolic subalgebras in the classical case
has been recently achieved in unpublished work of Duflo, Khalgui and Torasso.
In this paper, we investigate the quasi-reductivity of biparabolic subalgebras
of reductive Lie algebras. Biparabolic (or seaweed) subalgebras are the
intersection of two parabolic subalgebras whose sum is the total Lie algebra.
As a main result, we complete the classification of quasi-reductive parabolic
subalgebras of reductive Lie algebras by considering the exceptional cases.

was further finely-tuned by varying the oxygen content in very small amounts
through a vacuum anneal process. Measurements of the Hall effect at 300K and of

Approaching the SIT from the metallic side, and with decreasing T, R(T)
exhibits a high T metallic behaviour down to a temperature Tmin, followed by a
non metallic increase (dR/dT< 0) up to a maximum at Tp before the
superconducting transition at Tc. This re-entrant behaviour in R(T), commonly
observed in cuprates close to the SIT, is attributed to a phase segregation
phenomenon in the presence of strong electronic correlations and
inhomogeneities. We present our results extracted from R(T) and Hall effect
studies in the region close to the SIT and in the insulating region. A phase

state. Our full rovibrational investigation of the system includes the
interaction with the field due to the permanent electric dipole moment and the
polarizability of the molecule. We explore the evolution of the states next to
the dissociation threshold as the field strength is increased. The rotational
and vibrational dynamics are influenced by the field; effects such as
orientation, angular motion hybridization and squeezing of the vibrational
motion are demonstrated and analyzed. The field also induces avoided crossings
causing a strong mixing of the electrically dressed rovibrational states.
Importantly, we show how some of these highly excited levels can be shifted to
the continuum as the field strength is increased, and reversely how two atoms
in the continuum can be brought into a bound state by lowering the electric
field strength.

recovered within certain class of Lovelock theories possessing necessarily
cubic or higher order terms in curvature. This bounds the higher dimension to
be at least seven. Remarkably, the effective gauge coupling and Newton constant
in four dimensions are not proportional to the gravitational constant in higher
dimensions, but shifted with respect to their standard values. This effect
opens up new scenarios where a maximally symmetric solution in higher

through a gravitational analogue of ghost condensation. Indeed, this is what
occurs requiring both the extra dimensions and the four-dimensional

those slices can be chosen that have a neighbor slice already eaten. We prove a
conjecture of Peter Winkler by showing that Alice has a strategy for obtaining
4/9 of the pizza. This is best possible, that is, there is a cutting and a
strategy for Bob to get 5/9 of the pizza. We also give a characterization of
Alice's best possible gain depending on the number of slices. For a given
cutting of the pizza, we describe a linear time algorithm that computes Alice's
strategy gaining at least 4/9 of the pizza and another algorithm that computes
the optimal strategy for both players in any possible position of the game in
quadratic time. We distinguish two types of turns, shifts and jumps. We prove
that Alice can gain 4/9, 7/16 and 1/3 of the pizza if she is allowed to make at
most two jumps, at most one jump and no jump, respectively, and the three

help unravel the Majorana nature of neutrinos by a lepton number conserving

Reports (JCR) of the Science Citation Index- can be decomposed by indexers
and/or algorithmically. In this study, we test the results of two recently
available algorithms for the decomposition of large matrices against two
content-based classifications of journals: the ISI Subject Categories and the
field/subfield classification of Glaenzel & Schubert (2003). The content-based
schemes allow for the attribution of more than a single category to a journal,
whereas the algorithms maximize the ratio of within-category citations over
between-category citations in the aggregated category-category citation matrix.
By adding categories, indexers generate between-category citations, which may
enrich the database, for example, in the case of inter-disciplinary
developments. The consequent indexer effects are significant in sparse areas of
the matrix more than in denser ones. Algorithmic decompositions, on the other
hand, are more heavily skewed towards a relatively small number of categories,
while this is deliberately counter-acted upon in the case of content-based
classifications. Because of the indexer effects, science policy studies and the
sociology of science should be careful when using content-based
classifications, which are made for bibliographic disclosure, and not for the
purpose of analyzing latent structures in scientific communications. Despite
the large differences among them, the four classification schemes enable us to
generate surprisingly similar maps of science at the global level. Erroneous
classifications are cancelled as noise at the aggregate level, but may disturb

matrices P_i and Q_i can be obtained with one single R_r. Since the column of
Q_i can be used as the transmission beam of a particular user, multiple
solutions of Q_i provide a large selection of transmission beams, which can be
exploited to achieve high degrees of orthogonality between the multipaths, as
well as between the interfering users. Hence the proposed precoding technique

candidate as the main source of short-lived radionuclides in the early solar

stars experience proton captures at the base of the convective envelope (hot
bottom burning), together with high-neutron density nucleosynthesis with 22Ne
as a neutron source in the He shell and efficient dredge-up of the processed
material. A model of a 6.5 solar masses star of solar metallicity can
simultaneously match the abundances of 26Al, 41Ca, 60Fe, and 107Pd inferred to
have been present in the solar nebula by using a dilution factor of 1 part of
AGB material per 300 parts of original solar nebula material, and taking into
account a time interval between injection of the short-lived nuclides and
consolidation of the first meteorites equal to 0.53 Myr. Such a polluting
source does not overproduce 53Mn, as supernova models do, and only marginally
affects isotopic ratios of stable elements. It is usually argued that it is
unlikely that the short-lived radionuclides in the early solar system came from
an AGB star because these stars are rarely found in star forming regions,

the fundamental problem of the birth of our solar system.

for two probabilistically independent subsystems, it satisfies
$S_q(A+B)/k=[S_q(A)/k]+[S_q(B)/k]+(1-q)[S_q(A)/k][S_q(B)/k] \ne
S_q(A)/k+S_q(B)/k$. This form will turn out to be {\it extensive} for an
important class of nonlocal correlations, if $q$ is set equal to a special
value different from unity, noted $q_{ent}$ (where $ent$ stands for $entropy$).
In other words, for such systems, we verify that $S_{q_{ent}}(N) \propto N
(N>>1)$, thus legitimating the use of the classical thermodynamical relations.
Standard systems, for which $S_{BG}$ is extensive, obviously correspond to
$q_{ent}=1$. Quite complex systems exist in the sense that, for them, no value
of $q$ exists such that $S_q$ is extensive. Such systems are out of the present
scope: they might need forms of entropy different from $S_q$, or perhaps --
more plainly -- they are just not susceptible at all for some sort of
thermostatistical approach. Consistently with the results associated with
$S_q$, the $q$-generalizations of the Central Limit Theorem and of its extended
L\'evy-Gnedenko form have been achieved. These recent theorems could of course
be the cause of the ubiquity of $q$-exponentials, $q$-Gaussians and related
mathematical forms in natural, artificial and social systems. All of the above,
as well as presently available experimental, observational and computational
confirmations -- in high energy physics and elsewhere --, are briefly reviewed.
Finally, we address a confusion which is quite common in the literature, namely
referring to distinct physical mechanisms {\it versus} distinct regimes of a
single physical mechanism.

This synchronization eliminates collisions between particles and suppress the
diffusion induced by collisions by orders of magnitude. The minimum of the
diffusion is reached at the center of the synchronization regime corresponding
to the ratio 2:1 between the orbital frequency at the edge of B ring and the
orbital frequency of Mimas. The synchronization theory gives the sharpness of

rest separated at a distance $d$. This simple model when analyzed properly in
quantum field theory shows many interesting facets and helps to dispel some
misunderstandings of entanglement dynamics. We find that there is spatial
dependence of quantum entanglement in the stable regime due to the phase
difference of vacuum fluctuations the two detectors experience, together with
the interference of the mutual influences from the backreaction of one detector
on the other. When two initially entangled detectors are still outside each
other's light cone, the entanglement oscillates in time with an amplitude
dependent on spatial separation $d$. When the two detectors begin to have
causal contact, an interference pattern of the relative degree of entanglement
(compared to those at spatial infinity) develops a parametric dependence on
$d$. The detectors separated at those $d$ with a stronger relative degree of
entanglement enjoy longer disentanglement times. In the cases with weak
coupling and large separation, the detectors always disentangle at late times.
For sufficiently small $d$, the two detectors can have residual entanglement
even if they initially were in a separable state, while for $d$ a little
larger, there could be transient entanglement created by mutual influences.
However, we see no evidence of entanglement creation outside the light cone for
initially separable states.

fields produce partial decoherence via the Hanle effect, giving rise to
fascinating observable effects in the emergent spectral line polarization.
Interestingly, these effects allow us to ""see"" magnetic fields to which the

final away-side angular correlations in a static medium. For fully stopped
jets, the backreaction of the medium is described by a simple Bethe-Bloch-like
model which leads to an explosive burst of energy and momentum (Bragg peak)
close to the end of the jet's evolution through the medium. Surprisingly
enough, we find that the medium's response and the corresponding away-side
angular correlations are largely insensitive to whether the jet punches through
or stops inside the medium. This result is also independent of whether momentum
deposition is longitudinal (as generally occurs in pQCD energy loss models) or
transverse (as the Bethe-Bloch formula implies). The existence of the diffusion
wake is therefore shown to be universal to all scenarios where momentum as well
as energy is deposited into the medium, which can readily be understood in
ideal hydrodynamics through vorticity conservation. The particle yield coming
from the strong forward moving diffusion wake that is formed in the wake of
both punch-through and stopped jets largely overwhelms their weak Mach cone
signal after freeze-out.

This spatial coverage allows us to confirm the existence of a

very large fraction of the starforming galaxies in A851 have recently undergone
starbursts. We argue that starbursts are mostly confined to two kinds of sites:
infalling groups and the cluster center. At the cluster center it appears that
infalling galaxies are undergoing major mergers, resulting in starbursts whose
optical emission lines are completely buried beneath dust. The aftermath of
this process appears to be proto-S0 galaxies devoid of star formation. In
contrast, major mergers do not appear to be the cause of most of the starbursts
in infalling groups, and fewer of these events result in the transformation of
the galaxy into an S0. Some recent theoretical work provides possible
explanations for these two distinct processes, but it is not clear whether they

Extended ADC emission model provides very good fits to the spectra, the results
pointing clearly to a model for the nature of the Z-track, in agreement with
previous results for the similar source GX 340+0. In this model, at the soft
apex of the Z-track, the mass accretion rate Mdot is minimum and the neutron
star has its lowest temperature; but as the source moves along the normal
branch, the luminosity of the Comptonized emission increases, indicating that
Mdot increases and the neutron star gets hotter. The measured flux f of the
neutron star emission increases by a factor of ten becoming super-Eddington,
and we propose that this disrupts the inner disk so forming jets. In flaring,
the luminosity of the dominant Comptonized emission from the ADC is constant,
while the neutron star emission increases, and we propose for the first time
that flaring consists of unstable nuclear burning on the neutron star, and the
measured mass accretion rate per unit area mdot at the onset of flaring agrees
well with the theoretical critical value at which burning becomes unstable.
There is a striking correlation between the frequencies of the kHz QPO and the
ratio of the flux to the Eddington value: f/f_Edd, suggesting an explanation of
the higher frequency QPO and of its variation along the Z-track. It is well
known that a Keplerian orbit in the disk at this frequency corresponds to a
position some distance from the neutron star; we propose that the oscillation
always occurs at the inner disk edge, which moves radially outwards on the
upper normal and horizontal branches as the measured increasing radiation
pressure increasingly disrupts the inner disk.

orthorhombic structure at room temperature containing zigzag chains of V atoms
running along the c-axis. We have grown single crystals of CaV2O4 and report
crystallography, static magnetization, magnetic susceptibility \chi, ac
magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity Cp, and thermal expansion measurements
in the temperature T range of 1.8-350 K on the single crystals and on
polycrystalline samples. An orthorhombic to monoclinic structural distortion
and a long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) transition were found at
sample-dependent temperatures T_S \approx 108-145 K and T_N \approx 51-76 K,
respectively. In two annealed single crystals, another transition was found at
\approx 200 K. In one of the crystals, this transition is mostly due to V2O3
impurity phase that grows coherently in the crystals during annealing. However,
in the other crystal the origin of this transition at 200 K is unknown. The
\chi(T) shows a broad maximum at \approx 300 K associated with short-range AF
ordering and the anisotropy of \chi above T_N is small. The anisotropic \chi(T
\to 0) data below T_N show that the (average) easy axis of the AF magnetic
structure is the b-axis. The Cp(T) data indicate strong short-range AF ordering
above T_N, consistent with the \chi(T) data. We fitted our \chi(T) data near
room temperature by a J1-J2 S = 1 Heisenberg chain model, where J1(J2) is the
(next)-nearest-neighbor exchange interaction. We find J1 \approx 230 K, and
surprisingly, J2/J1 \approx 0 (or J1/J2 \approx 0). The interaction J_\perp
between these S = 1 chains leading to long-range AF ordering at T_N is
estimated to be J_\perp/J_1 \gtrsim 0.04.
