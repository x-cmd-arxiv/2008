wavefunction of the membrane with compact spatial topology \Sigma_h reproduces
the partition function of the bosonic string on worldsheet \Sigma_h. The
construction involves worldvolume matter at quantum criticality, described in
the simplest case by Lifshitz scalars with dynamical critical exponent z=2.
This matter system must be coupled to a novel theory of worldvolume gravity,
also exhibiting quantum criticality with z=2. We first construct such a
nonrelativistic ""gravity at a Lifshitz point"" with z=2 in D+1 spacetime
dimensions, and then specialize to the critical case of D=2 suitable for the
membrane worldvolume. We also show that in the second-quantized framework, the
string partition function is reproduced if the spacetime ground state takes the
form of a Bose-Einstein condensate of membranes in their first-quantized ground
states, correlated across all genera.

elliptical galaxies in a cosmological framework.
  Methods: We use a set of hydrodynamic, self-consistent simulations operating
in the context of a concordance cosmological model where relaxed
elliptical-like objects (ELOs) were identified at redshifts z=0, z=0.5, z=1 and
z=1.5.
  Results: The population of elliptical systems analysed here present a
systematic change through time, i.e. evolution, by becoming rounder in general
at z=0 and, at the same time more velocity dispersion supported. This is found
to be primarily due to major dry mergers where only a modest amount of angular
momentum is involved into the merger event. Despite the general trend, in a
significant amount of cases the merger event involves a higher specific angular
momentum, which in general causes the system to acquire a higher rotational
support and/or a more oblate shape. These evolutionary patterns are still
present when we study our systems in projection, mimicking real observations,
and thus they should become apparent in future observations.

four microquasars, i.e., Galactic black hole binary systems, with frequency
ratio very close to 3:2. In the microquasar GRS 1915+105, the structure of QPOs
exhibits additional frequencies, and more than two frequencies are observed in
the Galaxy nuclei Sgr A*, or in some extragalactic sources (NGC 4051,
MCG-6-30-15 and NGC 5408 X-1). The observed QPOs can be explained by a variety
of the orbital resonance model versions assuming resonance of oscillations with
the Keplerian frequency or the vertical epicyclic frequency, and the radial
epicyclic frequency, or some combinations of these frequencies. Generally,
different resonances could arise at different radii of an accretion disc.
However, we have shown that for special values of dimensionless black hole spin
strong resonant phenomena could occur when different resonances can be excited
at the same radius, as cooperative phenomena between the resonances may work in
such situations. The special values of black hole spin are determined for
triple frequency ratio sets \nu_{K} : \nu_{\theta} : \nu_{r} = s:t:u with s, t,
u being small integers. The most promising example of such a special situation
arises for black holes with extraordinary resonant spin a = 0.983 at the radius
r = 2.395 M, where \nu_{K} : \nu_{\theta} : \nu_{r} = 3:2:1. We also predict
that when combinations of the orbital frequencies are allowed, QPOs with four
frequency ratio set 4:3:2:1 could be observed in the field of black holes with
a = 0.866, 0.882 and 0.962. Assuming the extraordinary resonant spin a = 0.983
in Sgr A*, its QPOs with observed frequency ratio very close to 3:2:1 imply the
black hole mass in the interval 4.3 x 10^6 M_sun < M < 5.4 x 10^6 M_sun, in

origin for CP violation in early universe cosmology and in neutrino

quasi-degenerate right-handed neutrinos, with baryon asymmetry generated via
resonant leptogenesis. Three different models are found with specific textures
in the Yukawa coupling matrices, each with a single phase which controls
leptogenesis and neutrino CP violation. One model leads to normal hierarchy of
light neutrino masses and the prediction tan theta_13 = sin theta_12
\sqrt{m_2/m_3}, resulting in a value of the reactor mixing angle theta_13 very
close to the current experimental lower limit. The other two models predict
inverted hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum with the sum rules sin^2 theta_12
= 1/2-tan theta_23 sin theta_ 13 cos delta and sin^2 theta_12 = 1/2+cot
theta_23 sin theta_13 cos delta respectively. We obtain a lower bound for the
phase |delta| in the normal hierarchical model, and a narrow range for |delta|
for the inverted hierarchical model from cosmology. In our scenario, the
mass-splitting between the quasi-degenerate right-handed neutrinos arise via
renormalization group flow, which provides a lower limit on the MSSM parameter
tan beta > 12. The right-handed neutrino masses can be as low as TeV, which
would avoid the gravitino problem generic to supersymmetric models.

temperatures of secondary relaxation transitions. The entropic parameters of
the model are: the space dimension; the number of components of an ordering
field; the polymerization degree. The Kuhn segment, the melting temperature and
the difference of energies of two rotating isomers can be regarded as energetic
parameters. The model enables to calculate a number of important structural and
dynamic physical values: the density ratio of crystalline to amorphous phase;
the thicknesses of crystalline and amorphous layers in an isotropic lamellar
material; the crystallinity degree; the fluctuation spacing due to
entanglements; the neck draw ratio; the draw ratio at break; the elastic
deformation connected with gosh-trans transitions; etc. This model is based on
the assumption that there are exist two Lifshitz points in such polymers. The
neck draw ratio characterizes an irreversible process during which the energy
dissipation is observed. It is the main difference from magnetic systems, for
example. The results obtained are in a good agreement with experimental data

constructed from the geometry of spacetime by computing the L-functions
associated to omega motives of Calabi-Yau varieties, generated by their

from the omega motive and other motives of the intermediate cohomology are

happens that the finite frequency response of the photon absorption or the

nearby pulsars. While this possibility was pointed out a long time ago, the
greatly improved quality of current data potentially allow to reverse-engineer
the problem: given the regions of pulsar parameter space favored by PAMELA and
by ATIC, are there known pulsars that explain the data with reasonable
assumptions on the injected e+e- pairs? In the context of simple benchmark
models for estimating the e+e- output, we consider all known pulsars, as listed
in the most complete available catalogue. We find that it is unlikely that a
single pulsar be responsible for both the PAMELA e+ fraction anomaly and for
the ATIC excess, although two single sources are in principle enough to explain
both experimental results. The PAMELA excess e+ likely come from a set of
mature pulsars (age ~ 10^6 yr), with a distance of 0.8-1 kpc, or from a single,
younger and closer source like Geminga. The ATIC data require a larger (and
less plausible) energy output, and favor an origin associated to powerful, more
distant (1-2 kpc) and younger (age ~ 10^5$ yr) pulsars. We list several
candidate pulsars that can individually or coherently contribute to explain the
PAMELA and ATIC data. Although generally suppressed, we find that the
contribution of pulsars more distant than 1-2 kpc could contribute for the ATIC
excess. Finally, we stress the multi-faceted and decisive role that Fermi-LAT
will play in the very near future by (1) providing an exquisite measurement of
the e+e- flux, (2) unveiling the existence of as yet undetected pulsars, and
(3) searching for anisotropies in the arrival direction of high-energy e+e-.

system, that dates back to the mid 1970s. The symmetrical network theory is
based on symmetrical stimulatory, inhibitory and killing interactions between
clones that are specific for each other. Previous papers described roles for
helper and suppressor T cells in regulating immune responses and a model for
HIV pathogenesis. This paper extends the theory to account for regulatory T
cells that include three types of suppressor cells called Ts1, Ts2 and Ts3, and
two types of helper cells called Th1 and Th2. The theory leads to a concept for
an HIV vaccine, namely a reagent commonly known as IVIG, to be administered in
small amounts in an immunogenic form via an immunogenic route. Predictions are
made for experiments in mice and macaque monkeys.

compare the DMTs of traditional time-division multihop (TDMH) and network

NC. This shows, surprisingly, that if relay nodes collaborate NC does not
always have a better DMT than TDMH since it is difficult to simultaneously
achieve bidirectional transmit diversity for both source nodes. In fact, for
certain traffic patterns NC can have a worse DMT due to suboptimal time
allocation between the forward and reverse transmission directions.

disturbed stars are supplied into the loss cone. Stars of the dwarf galaxy are
also supplied into the loss cone. The gravitational interactions between the

interaction decreases the binding energy of the SMBH binary effectively. As a
result, the shrink of the separation of the SMBH binary is accelerated. Our

presence of some hidden symmetry or other structure. These observations were
later explained by the discovery of (N - 3) constants of motion, each choice of
which confines the resulting flow in phase space to a low-dimensional invariant
manifold. Here we show that the dimensionality can be reduced further by
restricting attention to a special family of states recently identified by Ott

invariant submanifold of dimension one less than that found earlier. We derive
and analyze the flow on this submanifold for two special cases: an array with

non-differentiability and regularity of these functions. We find many phenomena

It is shown that there are two threshold voltages, $V_{th,1}$ and $V_{th,2}$,

exist in the research of quark matter and compact stars. This paper addresses
the possibility that quark clustering, rather than a color super-conducting
state, could occur in cold quark matter at realistic baryon densities of
compact stars, since a weakly coupling treatment of the interaction between
quarks might not be reliable. Cold quark matter is conjectured to be in a solid
state if thermal kinematic energy is much lower than the interaction energy of
quark clusters. Different manifestations of pulsar-like compact stars are
discussed, as well as modeled in a regime of solid quark stars.

dark energy equation of state. The dynamics of the collapse of the halo is
governed by the form of the quintessence potential, the time evolution of its
equation of state, the initial conditions of the field and its homogeneity
nature in the highly non--linear regime. These have a direct impact on the
turnaround, virialisation and collapse times, altering in consequence the
non--linear density contrast and virial radius. We compute halo concentrations
using the Eke, Navarro & Steinmetz algorithm, examining two extreme scenarios:
first, we assume that the quintessence field does not exhibit fluctuations on
cluster scales and below - homogeneous fluid; second, we assume that the field
inside the overdensity collapses along with the dark matter - inhomogeneous
fluid. The Eke, Navarro & Steinmetz prescription reveals, in general, higher
halo concentrations in inhomogeneous dark energy models than in their
homogeneous equivalents. Halo concentrations appear to be controlled by both
changes in formation epochs of the halo cores as well as by differing
virialisation overdensities. We derive physical halo properties in all models
and discuss their observational implications. We examine two possible methods
for comparing observations with theoretical predictions. The first method works
on galaxy cluster scales and consists of fitting the observed X-ray cluster gas
density distributions to those predicted for an NFW profile. The second method
works on galaxy scales and involves the observational measurement of the
so--called central density parameter.

the non-universal Higgs mass model (NUHM). Since the heaviest neutralino

be detectable at the LHC. In such a case, we showed that the hierarchy of $M_1,

analyzed in detail, using Monte-Carlo calculations and experimentally

the TRION detector. In contrast to event-counting detectors where the
signal-to-noise ratio is dependent only on the number of detected events
(quantum noise), in an energy-integrating detector additional factors, such as
the fluctuations in imparted energy, number of photoelectrons, system gain and
other factors will contribute to the noise. The excess noise factor (over the
quantum noise) due to these processes was 4.3, 2.7, 2.1, 1.9 and 1.9 for

shown that, even under ideal light collection conditions, a fast neutron

turns out that only the case with the choice $R_{\rm CC}^{-2}= \dot H +2H^2$,

group method for a non-uniform Hamiltonian, which has deformed interaction
strength of $j$-th bond proportional to $\cosh \lambda j$, the uniform
Hamiltonian is analyzed as a limit of $\lambda \to 0$. As a consequence of the
deformation, an excited quasi-particle is weakly bounded around the center of
the system, and kept away from the system boundary. Therefore, insensitivity of
an estimated excitation gap of the deformed system to the boundary allows us to
have the bulk excitation gap $\Delta(\lambda)$, and shift in $\Delta(\lambda)$
from $\Delta(0)$ is nearly linear in $\lambda$ when $\lambda \ll 1$. Efficiency
of this estimation is demonstrated through application to the S=1
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain. Combining the above estimation and another
one obtained from the technique of convergence acceleration for finite-size

$\Lambda$/charm-hadron production, as well as of the hadronic structure of

the outer star is disrupted by a nodal libration induced by the inner binary
pair on a shorter timescale. By empirically modelling the period of the
libration, a criteria for determining the high inclination stability limits in
general triple systems is derived. The nodal libration feature is interesting
and, although effecting inclination and node only, shows many parallels to the

coupling value for either s- or d-wave superconductivity. The characteristic
length scales of the deviations from the average gap value, and of an
anti-correlation discovered between the gap magnitude and the zero bias
conductance, match well with the average separation between the Co dopant ions
in the superconducting FeAs planes. The tunneling spectra themselves possess a
peak-dip-hump lineshape, suggestive of a coupling of the superconducting
electronic system to a well-defined bosonic mode of energy 4.7 kBTC, such as
the spin resonance observed recently in inelastic neutron scattering.

(HST) Treasury program designed to provide a new large, deep and homogeneous
photometric database. Based on observations from this program, we have measured
precise relative ages for a sample of 64 Galactic globular clusters by
comparing the relative position of the clusters' main sequence turn offs, using
main-sequence fitting to cross-compare clusters within the sample. This method
provides relative ages to a formal precision of 2-7%. We demonstrate that the
calculated relative ages are independent of the choice of theoretical model. We
find that the Galactic globular cluster sample can be divided into two groups
-- a population of old clusters with an age dispersion of ~5% and no
age-metallicity relation, and a group of younger clusters with an
age-metallicity relation similar to that of the globular clusters associated
with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
  These results are consistent with the Milky Way halo having formed in two
phases or processes. The first one would be compatible with a rapid (<0.8 Gyr)
assembling process of the halo, in which the clusters in the old group were
formed. Also these clusters could have been formed before reionization in dwarf
galaxies that would later merge to build the Milky Way halo as predicted by
Lambda-CDM cosmology. However, the galactocentric metallicity gradient shown by
these clusters seems difficult to reconcile with the latter. As for the younger
clusters, it is very tempting to argue that their origin is related to their
formation within Milky Way satellite galaxies that were later accreted, but the
origin of the age-metallicity relation remains unclear.

scattering reactions ($\nu_\mu n\to \mu^- p$ and $\bar{\nu}_\mu p\to \mu^+ n$)
using a set of experimental data collected by the NOMAD collaboration. We have
performed measurements of the cross-section of these processes on a nuclear
target (mainly Carbon) normalizing it to the total $\nu_\mu$ ($\bar{\nu}_\mu$)
charged current cross-section. The results for the flux averaged QEL
cross-sections in the (anti)neutrino energy interval 3-100 GeV are
$\sigma^{qel}_{\nu_\mu} = (0.92 \pm 0.02 (stat) \pm 0.06 (syst))\times 10^{-38}
\cm^2$ and $\sigma{qel}_{\bar{\nu}_\mu} = (0.81 \pm 0.05 (stat) \pm 0.08
(syst))\times 10^{-38} \cm^2$ for neutrino and antineutrino, respectively. The
axial mass parameter $M_A$ was extracted from the measured quasi-elastic
neutrino cross-section. The corresponding result is $M_A = 1.05 \pm 0.02 (stat)
\pm 0.06 (syst) GeV$. It is consistent with the axial mass values recalculated
from the antineutrino cross-section and extracted from the pure $Q^2$ shape
analysis of the high purity sample of $\nu_\mu$ quasi-elastic 2-track events,
but has smaller systematic error and should be quoted as the main result of
this work. Our measured $M_A$ is found to be in good agreement with the world
average value obtained in previous deuterium filled bubble chamber experiments.
The NOMAD measurement of $M_A$ is lower than those recently published by K2K
and MiniBooNE collaborations. However, within the large errors quoted by these
experiments on $M_A$, these results are compatible with the more precise NOMAD
value.
