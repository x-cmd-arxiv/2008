precision in the last few decades. However there are still phenomena in nature
which cannot be explained, and as such new theories will be required. Since
terrestrial experiments are limited in both the energy and precision that can
be probed, new methods are required to search for signs of physics beyond the
Standard Model. In this dissertation, I demonstrate how these theories can be
probed by searching for remnants of their effects in the early Universe. In
particular I focus on three possible extensions of the Standard Model: the
addition of massive neutral particles as dark matter (through the use of
several minimal models of dark matter), the addition of charged massive
particles (through catalyzed Big Bang Nucleosynthesis), and the existence of
higher dimensions (through its effects on BBN and galactic positron
production). For each new model, I review the existing experimental bounds and
the potential for discovering new physics in the next generation of
experiments.

neutron-proton asymmetry alpha=(N-Z)/A to all orders in alpha. Good agreement
(at the 10% level or better) is found between these numerical calculations and
analytic expansions that are given in terms of a handful of bulk parameters
determined at saturation density. Using insights developed from the analytic
approach and a general expression for the incompressibility coefficient of
infinite neutron-rich matter, i.e., K0(alpha)=K0+Ktau*alpha^{2}+..., we
construct a Hybrid model with values for K0 and Ktau as suggested by recent
experimental findings. Whereas the Hybrid model provides a better description
of the measured distribution of isoscalar monopole strength in the Sn-isotopes
relative to both NL3 and FSUGold, it significantly underestimates the
distribution of strength in 208Pb. Thus, we conclude that the incompressibility

dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate(BEC) with large dipole moments (treated as a
classical spin) can be modeled using an extended Non-linear sigma model (NLSM)
like energy functional with an additional non-local term that represents long
ranged anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction. Minimizing this effective energy
functional we calculate the density and spin-profile of the dipolar
Bose-Einstein condensate in the mean-field regime for various trapping
geometries. The resulting configurations show strong intertwining between the
spin and mass density of the condensate, transfer between spin and orbital
angular momentum in the form of Einstein-de Hass effect, and novel topological
properties. We have also described the theoretical framework in which the
collective excitations around these mean field solutions can be studied and
discuss some examples qualitatively.

lenticulars with our data, we study correlations between parameters that
characterise the bulge and the disk as a function of luminosity and
environment. We find that scaling relations such as the Kormendy relation,
photometric plane and other correlations involving bulge and disk parameters
show a luminosity dependence. This dependence can be explained in terms of
galaxy formation models in which faint lenticulars (M_T > -24.5) formed via
secular formation processes that likely formed the pseudobulges of late-type
disk galaxies, while brighter lenticulars (M_T < -24.5) formed through a
different formation mechanism most likely involving major mergers. On probing
variations in lenticular properties as a function of environment, we find that
faint cluster lenticulars show systematic differences with respect to faint
field lenticulars. These differences support the idea that the bulge and disk
components fade after the galaxy falls into a cluster, while simultaneously
undergoing a transformation from spiral to lenticular morphologies.

merely a result of the interplay between gravitational energy density,
generated by the contraction of space by matter, and the energy density of the
Cosmological Microwave Background (CMB), which causes space dilation. In the
universe, globally, the gravitational energy density equals the CMB energy
density. This leads to the derivation of the Hubble parameter, H, as a function
of the scale factor, a, the time, t, the redshift, z, and to the calculation of
its present value. It also leads to a new understanding of the cosmological
redshift and the Euclidian nature of the universe. From H(t) we conclude that
the time derivative of a is constant. This is in contrast to the consensus of
the last decade. This result is supported by the fit of our theoretically
derived flux from supernovae (SN) as a function of z, with observation. This
flux is derived based on our H(z) that determines DL, the Luminosity Distance.
We obtain this fit without any free parameters, whereas in current cosmology
this fit is obtained by using the dependent free parameters Omega_M and

have strong internal relaxation of energy which aligns grain axis of maximum
moment of inertia with respect to grain's angular momentum. In this paper, we
study the alignment by radiative torques for large irregular grains, e.g.,
grains in accretion disks, for which internal relaxation is subdominant. We use
both numerical calculations and the analytical model of a helical grain
introduced by us earlier. We demonstrate that grains in such a regime exhibit
more complex dynamics. In particular, if initially the grain axis of maximum
moment of inertia makes a small angle with angular momentum, then radiative
torques can align the grain axis of maximum moment of inertia with angular
momentum, and both axis of maximum moment of inertia and angular momentum are
aligned with the magnetic field when attractors with high angular momentum
(high-J attractors) are available. For the alignment without high-J attractors,
beside the earlier studied attractors with low angular momentum (low-J
attractors), there appears new low-J attractors. The former and later cases
correspond to the alignment with long axes perpendicular and parallel to the
angular momentum, respectively. In addition, we study the alignment of grains
in the presence of strong internal relaxation, but induced not by a radiation
beam as in earlier studies, instead, induced by a complex radiation field, that
can be decomposed into dipole and quadrupole components. We find that in this
situation, the parameter space $q^{max}$, for the existence of high-$J$
attractors is more extended, which entails higher degrees of polarization
expected. Our obtained results are useful for modeling polarization arising

magnetic fields are, at least, weakly stochastic. Therefore realistic studies
of astrophysical magnetic reconnection should include the effects of stochastic
magnetic field. In the paper we discuss and test numerically the Lazarian &
Vishniac (1999) model of magnetic field reconnection of weakly stochastic
fields. The turbulence in the model is assumed to be subAlfvenic, with the
magnetic field only slightly perturbed. The model predicts that the degree of
magnetic field stochasticity controls the reconnection rate and that the
reconnection can be fast independently on the presence or absence of anomalous
plasma effects. For testing of the model we use 3D MHD simulations. To measure
the reconnection rate we employ both the inflow of magnetic flux and a more
sophisticated measure that we introduce in the paper. Both measures of
reconnection provide consistent results. Our testing successfully reproduces
the dependences predicted by the model, including the variations of the
reconnection speed with the variations of the injection scale of turbulence
driving as well as the intensity of driving. We conclude that, while anomalous
and Hall-MHD effects in particular circumstances may be important for the
initiation of reconnection, the generic astrophysical reconnection is fast due
to turbulence, irrespectively of the microphysical plasma effects involved.
This conclusion justifies numerical modeling of many astrophysical
environments, e.g. interstellar medium, for which plasma-effect-based
collisionless reconnection is not applicable.

laminar two-dimensional incompressible flow which is known to produce chaotic
mixing is studied. We develop a method for detecting barriers to cross-jet
transport in the phase space which is a physical space for our model. Using
tools from theory of nontwist maps, we construct a central invariant curve and
compute its characteristics that may serve good indicators of the existence of
a central transport barrier, its strength, and topology. Computing fractal
dimension, length, and winding number of that curve in the parameter space, we
study in detail change of its geometry and its destruction that are caused by
local bifurcations and a global bifurcation known as reconnection of
separatrices of resonances. Scenarios of reconnection are different for odd and
even resonances. The central invariant curves with rational and irrational
(noble) values of winding numbers are arranged into hierarchical series which
are described in terms of continued fractions. Destruction of central transport
barrier is illustrated for two ways in the parameter space: when moving along
resonant bifurcation curves with rational values of the winding number and
along curves with noble (irrational) values.

$^3$He nucleus within the framework of the hard rescattering model (HRM). In
the HRM a quark of one nucleon knocked out by an incoming photon rescatters
with a quark of the other nucleon leading to the production of two nucleons
with large relative momentum. Assuming the dominance of the quark-interchange
mechanism in a hard NN scattering, the HRM allows to express the amplitude of a
two-nucleon break-up reaction through the convolution of photon-quark
scattering, $NN$ hard scattering amplitude and nuclear spectral function. The
photon-quark scattering amplitude can be explicitly calculated in the high
energy regime, whereas for $NN$ scattering one uses the fit of the available
experimental data. The HRM predicts several specific features for the hard
breakup reaction. First, the cross section will approximately scale as
$s^{-11}$. Secondly, the $s^{11}$ weighted cross section will have the shape of
energy dependence similar to that of $s^{10}$ weighted $NN$ elastic scattering
cross section. Also one predicts an enhancement of the $pp$ breakup relative to
the $pn$ breakup cross section as compared to the results from low energy
kinematics. Another result is the prediction of different spectator momentum
dependencies of $pp$ and $pn$ breakup cross sections. This is due to the fact
that same-helicity $pp$-component is strongly suppressed in the ground state
wave function of $^3$He. Because of this suppression the HRM predicts
significantly different asymmetries for the cross section of polarization
transfer $NN$ breakup reactions for circularly polarized photons. For the $pp$
breakup this asymmetry is predicted to be zero while for the $pn$ it is close
to ${2\over 3}$.

weakened form of the Chowla Hypothesis imply that every sufficiently large even
integer may be written as the sum of two distinct primes.

  Dans ce document, nous essayons d'\'{e}tudier les relations entre la
conjecture de Goldbach et le plus petit nombre premier dans une progression
arithm\'{e}tique. Nous donnons une nouvelle forme faible de la conjecture de
Goldbach. Nous prouvons que cette forme affaiblie et une forme affaiblie de
l'hypoth\`{e}se de Chowla impliquent que tout entier pair suffisamment grand
peut \^{e}tre \'{e}crit comme une somme de deux nombres premiers distincts.

Gross-Pitaeviskii equation with attractive interactions and in two- and
three-dimensional optical lattices. In absence of the periodic potential the
solution reduces to the known Townes solitons of the multi-dimensional
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation, sharing with these the propriety of being
unstable against small norm (number of atoms) variations. We show that in the
presence of the optical lattice the solution separates stable localized
solutions (gap-solitons) from decaying ones, characterizing the delocalizing
transition occurring in the multidimensional case. The link between these
higher dimensional solutions and the ones of one dimensional nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation with higher order nonlinearities is also discussed.

of entanglement witnesses to detect tri-partite entanglement to the phenomenon
of entanglement sudden death (ESD). Using a system subject to dephasing I
invoke entanglement witnesses to detect tri-partite GHZ and W-type entanglement
and compare the evolution of their detection capabilites with the evolution of
the negativity, bi-partite concurrence, and tri-partite negativity.
Interestingly, I find a state in which there is no concurrence or tri-partite
negativity but there is entanglement. Finally, I utilize a three qubit quantum
error correction (QEC) code to address how ESD affects the abilities of quantum
error correction.
