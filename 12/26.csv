states. We have varied the nature of interaction amongst the particles of the
system under consideration in order to reveal the possible presence of
universality (i.e. independence of the potential). For clusters, the number of
particles is varied to investigate the effect of finite size on various
properties. To study bulk amorphous systems, we actually use periodic crystals
with as large a primitive cell as possible. For any finite disorder, the number
of particles in the primitive cell should ideally be made arbitrarily large.
However, in practice, this is limited by the available computational resources.
We should note here that due to the periodic nature of our approximation to the
bulk disordered system, the analysis of spectral fluctuations becomes a lot
more subtle and has not been reported in this thesis. We report results only
on: (1) Universality in the density of states for clusters, (2) Universality in
spectral fluctuations in the case of clusters, and (3) Universality in the
density of states for bulk amorphous systems.

Standard Model Higgs, strongly non-minimally coupled to gravity, plays the role
of the inflaton. We find that the Universe does not reheat immediately through
perturbative decays, but rather initiate a complex process in which
perturbative and non-perturbative effects are mixed. The Higgs condesate starts
oscillating around the minimum of its potential, producing W and Z gauge bosons
non-perturbatively, due to violation of the so-called adiabaticity condition.
However, during each semi-oscillation, the created gauge bosons completely
decay (perturbatively) into fermions. This way, the decay of the gauge bosons
prevents the development of parametric resonance, since bosons cannot
accummulate significantly at the beginning. However, the energy transferred to
the decay products of the bosons is not enough to reheat the universe, so after
about a hundred oscillations, the resonance effect will finally dominate over
the perturbative decays. Around the same time (or slightly earlier),
backreaction from the gauge bosons onto the Higgs condensate will also start to
be significant. Soon afterwards, the Universe is filled with the remnant
condensate of the Higgs and a non-thermal distribution of Standard Model
particles which redshift as radiation, while the Higgs continues to oscillate
as a pressureless fluid. We compute the distribution of energy among all the
species present at backreaction. From there on until thermalization, the
evolution of the system is highly non-linear and non-perturbative, and will
require a careful study via numerical simulations.

both the monopoles and the vortices are released into the thermal vacuum
contributing, in particular, to the equation of state and, definitely, to
transport properties of the hot gluonic medium. Thus, we argue that a novel,
magnetic component plays a crucial role. On the other hand, it was demonstrated
that an effective three-dimensional description can be brought, beginning with
high temperatures, down to the critical temperature by postulating existence of
a system of 3d Higgs fields. We propose to identify the 3d color-singlet Higgs

process and apply this method to a realistic example. The example is two
electron spin qubits coupled through the dipole and exchange interactions with
unknown coupling parameters -- explicitly, the position vector relating the two
qubits and the magnitude of the exchange interaction are unknown. This coupling
Hamiltonian generates a unitary evolution which, when combined with arbitrary
single-qubit operations, produces a universal set of quantum gates. However,
the unknown parameters must be known precisely to generate high-fidelity gates.
We use the Cram\'er-Rao bound on the variance of a point estimator to construct
the optimal series of experiments to estimate these free parameters, and
present a complete analysis of the optimal experimental configuration. Our
method of transforming the constrained optimal parameter estimation problem
into a convex optimization is powerful and widely applicable to other systems.

of representations of finite groups of Lie type in mind, character sheaves are
perfectly well defined for reductive algebraic groups over any algebraically

algebraic group $G$ over an algebraic closure of a field $K$ and characters of
representations of $G(K)$ is well understood only when $K$ is a finite field
and when $K$ is the field of complex numbers. In this paper we consider the
case when $K$ is a non-Archimedean local field and explain how to match certain
character sheaves of a connected reductive algebraic group $G$ with virtual

Japan 62 (2010), no. 3, 687-705",,,"math.NT math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1947, Lehmer conjectured that the Ramanujan $\tau$-function $\tau (m)$
never vanishes for all positive integers $m$, where the $\tau (m)$ are the
Fourier coefficients of the cusp form $\Delta_{24}$ of weight 12. Lehmer
verified the conjecture in 1947 for $m<214928639999$. In 1973, Serre verified
up to $m<10^{15}$, and in 1999, Jordan and Kelly for $m<22689242781695999$.
  The theory of spherical $t$-design, and in particular those which are the
shells of Euclidean lattices, is closely related to the theory of modular
forms, as first shown by Venkov in 1984. In particular, Ramanujan's
$\tau$-function gives the coefficients of a weighted theta series of the
$E_{8}$-lattice. It is shown, by Venkov, de la Harpe, and Pache, that $\tau
(m)=0$ is equivalent to the fact that the shell of norm $2m$ of the
$E_{8}$-lattice is an 8-design. So, Lehmer's conjecture is reformulated in
terms of spherical $t$-design.
  Lehmer's conjecture is difficult to prove, and still remains open. In this
paper, we consider toy models of Lehmer's conjecture. Namely, we show that the
$m$-th Fourier coefficient of the weighted theta series of the
$\mathbb{Z}^2$-lattice and the $A_{2}$-lattice does not vanish, when the shell
of norm $m$ of those lattices is not the empty set. In other words, the
spherical 5 (resp. 7)-design does not exist among the shells in the
$\mathbb{Z}^2$-lattice (resp. $A_{2}$-lattice).

the number of clusters needs to be relatively large and open-ended. This
problem gets further complicated in a co-clustering scenario in which one needs
to solve multiple clustering problems simultaneously because of the presence of
common centroids (e.g., ancestors) shared by clusters (e.g., possible descents
from a certain ancestor) from different multiple-cluster samples (e.g.,
different human subpopulations). In this paper we present a hierarchical
nonparametric Bayesian model to address this problem in the context of
multi-population haplotype inference. Uncovering the haplotypes of single
nucleotide polymorphisms is essential for many biological and medical
applications. While it is uncommon for the genotype data to be pooled from
multiple ethnically distinct populations, few existing programs have explicitly
leveraged the individual ethnic information for haplotype inference. In this
paper we present a new haplotype inference program, Haploi, which makes use of
such information and is readily applicable to genotype sequences with thousands
of SNPs from heterogeneous populations, with competent and sometimes superior
speed and accuracy comparing to the state-of-the-art programs. Underlying
Haploi is a new haplotype distribution model based on a nonparametric Bayesian
formalism known as the hierarchical Dirichlet process, which represents a
tractable surrogate to the coalescent process. The proposed model is
exchangeable, unbounded, and capable of coupling demographic information of
different populations.

in genus zero for quintic polynomials in five variables and we show that it
matches the Gromov-Witten genus-zero theory of the quintic three-fold via a
symplectic transformation. More specifically, we show that the J-function
encoding the Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory on the A-side equals via a mirror
map the I-function embodying the period integrals at the Gepner point on the
B-side. This identification inscribes the physical Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau
correspondence within the enumerative geometry of moduli of curves, matches the
genus-zero invariants computed by the physicists Huang, Klemm, and Quackenbush
at the Gepner point, and yields via Givental's quantization a prediction on the
relation between the full higher genus potential of the quintic three-fold and
that of Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory.

characteristic Fermi surface structure of iron-pnictide, column like response
is found at (pi, 0) in extended Brillouin zone in the undoped case, which is
consistent with the recent neutron scattering experiment. This indicates that
the localized spin model is not necessary to explain the spin dynamics of this

fluxes increasing with frequency, spectrally separated from the well known
microwave component. Rapid pulsations are found present in all events observed
at the two frequencies of the solar submillimeter-wave telescope (SST): 212 and
405 GHz. They were studied in greater detail for three solar bursts exhibiting
the new THz spectral component. The pulse amplitudes are of about 5-8% of the
mean flux throughout the bursts durations, being comparable for both
frequencies. Pulsations range from one pulse every few seconds to 8-10 per
second. The pulse repetition rates (R) are linearly proportional to the mean
burst fluxes (S), following the simple relationship S = k R, suggesting that
the pulsations might be the response to discrete flare particle accelerator
injections quantized in energy. Although this result is consistent with
qualitative trends previously found in the GHz range, the pulse amplitude
relative to the mean fluxes at the sub-THz frequencies appear to be nearly ten
times smaller than expected from the extrapolation of the trends found in the
GHz range. However there are difficulties to reconcile the nearly simultaneous
GHz and THz burst emission spectrally separated components, exhibiting rapid
pulsations with considerably larger relative intensities in the GHz range.

rapid decay phase (RDP) in their X-ray lightcurve, which is usually a smooth
continuation of the prompt gamma-ray emission, strongly suggesting that it is
its tail. However, the mechanism behind it is still not clear. The most popular
model for this RDP is High Latitude Emission (HLE). While HLE is expected in
many models for the prompt GRB emission, such as the popular internal shocks
model, there are models in which it is not expected, such as sporadic magnetic
reconnection events. Therefore, testing whether the RDP is consistent with HLE
can help distinguish between different prompt emission models. We address this
question by modeling the prompt emission as the sum of its individual pulses
with their HLE tails. Analytic expressions for the observed flux density are
obtained for power-law and Band function emission spectra. For internal shocks
the observed instantaneous spectrum is very close to the emitted one, and
should be well described by a Band function also during the RDP. Our model
naturally produces, the observed spectral softening and steepening of the flux
decay. The observed flux during the RDP is initially dominated by the tail of
the last pulse, but the tails of one or more earlier pulses can become dominant
later on. Moreover, modeling several overlapping pulses as a single wider pulse
would over-predict the emission tail. Thus, one should be very careful when
testing the predictions of HLE and do a combined temporal and spectral fit of
the prompt GRB emission and the RDP.
