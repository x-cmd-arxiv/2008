open-quantum-system dynamics, quantum measurements, and quantum error
correction (QEC). The first topic concerns weak measurements and their
universality as a means of generating quantum operations. It is shown that
every generalized measurement can be implemented as a sequence of weak
(infinitesimal) measurements. The second topic is an application of this result
to the theory of entanglement. Necessary and sufficient differential conditions
for entanglement monotones are derived and are used to find a new entanglement
monotone for three-qubit states. The third topic is a study of the performance
of different master equations for the description of non-Markovian dynamics.
The system studied is a qubit coupled to a spin bath via the Ising interaction.
The fourth topic investigates continuous QEC in the presence of non-Markovian
noise. It is shown that due to the existence of a Zeno regime in non-Markovian
dynamics, the performance of continuous QEC exhibits a quadratic improvement
for a sufficiently high time resolution of the error-correcting operations. The
fifth topic studies the conditions for correctability of subsystem codes under
continuous dynamics. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the Lindbladian and
the system-environment Hamiltonian are derived. The sixth topic examines the
robustness of operator QEC codes against initialization errors. A new measure
of fidelity for encoded information is introduced and is used to show that
operator codes are robust against imperfect initialization without the need for
restriction of the standard operator QEC conditions. The last topic concerns
holonomic quantum computation (HQC) and stabilizer codes. A fault-tolerant
scheme for HQC is presented, proving the scalability of the holonomic approach.

Indeed, a growing number of permeability inducing factors (PIFs) was shown to
elicit signaling mechanisms culminating in VE-cadherin destabilization and
global alteration of the junctional architecture. Conversely, anti-PIFs protect
from VE-cadherin disruption and enhance cell cohesion. These findings provide

the study of the growth of real-size tumors with several millions of cells, it
is best to use a macroscopic model having the form of a partial differential
equation (PDE) for the density of cells. The difficulty is to predict the
effect, at the macroscopic scale, of contact interactions that take place at
the microscopic scale. To address this we use a multiscale approach: starting
from a very simple, yet experimentally validated, microscopic model of
migration with contact interactions, we derive a macroscopic model. We show
that a diffusion equation arises, as is often postulated in the field of glioma
modeling, but it is nonlinear because of the interactions. We give the explicit
dependence of diffusivity on the cell density and on a parameter governing
cell-cell interactions. We discuss in details the conditions of validity of the
approximations used in the derivation and we compare analytic results from our
PDE to numerical simulations and to some in vitro experiments. We notice that
the family of microscopic models we started from includes as special cases some
kinetically constrained models that were introduced for the study of the

to reflect faithfully the features of the corresponding H-T phase diagram.
Within the lower ranges of temperature and fields, the calculations based on
linearized field-dependent spin-wave theory are found to reproduce
satisfactorily the measured Cm(T,H) curves: accordingly, within these ranges,
the thermodynamical properties of these compounds can be rationalized in terms

the impact of the complete supersymmetric QCD(SQCD) next-to-leading order(NLO)
radiative corrections on this process at a polarized or unpolarized photon
collider, and make a comparison between the effects of the SQCD and the
standard model(SM) QCD. We investigate the dependence of the lowest-order(LO)

standard model(MSSM) on colliding energy $\sqrt{s}$ in different polarized
photon collision modes. The LO, SM NLO and SQCD NLO corrected distributions of
the invariant mass of $t\bar t$-pair and the transverse momenta of final
$Z^0$-boson are presented. Our numerical results show that the pure SQCD
effects in \ggttz process can be more significant in the $+ +$ polarized photon

nucleate out of the state with no classical space and time. As known, in case
of classical cosmology with varying speed of light $c(t)$ it is possible to
solve the horizon problem, the flatness problem and the $\Lambda$-problem if
$c=sa^n$ with $s$=const and $n<-2$. We show that in VSL quantum cosmology with
$n<-2$ the semiclassical tunneling nucleation probability is
$\emph{P}\sim\exp(-\beta^2\Lambda^k)$ with $\beta$=const and $k>0$. Thus, the
semiclassical tunneling nucleation probability in VSL quantum cosmology is very
different from that in quantum cosmology with $c$=const. In particular, it can
be strongly suppressed for large values of $\Lambda$. In addition, we propose
two instantons that describe the nucleation of closed universes in VSL models.
These solutions are akin to the Hawking-Turok instanton in sense of O(4)
invariance but, unlike to it, are both non-singular. Moreover, using those
solutions we can obtain the probability of nucleation which is suppressed for
large value of $\Lambda$ too. We also discuss some unusual properties of models

consider various problems on centralized link scheduling in Spatial Time

spatial reuse as performance metric and provide an explicit characterization of
spatial reuse. We propose link scheduling algorithms based on certain graph
models (communication graph, SINR graph) of the network. Our algorithms achieve
higher spatial reuse than that of existing algorithms, with only a slight
increase in computational complexity. (2) We investigate random access

powers of users on the basis of quaternary channel feedback. We model the
algorithm dynamics by a Discrete Time Markov Chain and consequently show that
its maximum stable throughput is 0.5518. Our algorithm achieves higher maximum
