matter theory, especially in the theory of low-dimensional quantum spin
systems. The aim of this chapter is to review the application of the
Jordan-Wigner fermionization technique for calculating dynamic quantities of
low-dimensional quantum spin models. After a brief introduction of the
Jordan-Wigner transformation for one-dimensional spin one-half systems and some
of its extensions for higher dimensions and higher spin values we focus on the
dynamic properties of several low-dimensional quantum spin models. We start
from the famous s=1/2 XX chain. As a first step we recall well-known results
for dynamics of the z-spin-component fluctuation operator and then turn to the
dynamics of the dimer and trimer fluctuation operators. The dynamics of the
trimer fluctuations involves both the two-fermion (one particle and one hole)
and the four-fermion (two particles and two holes) excitations. We discuss some
properties of the two-fermion and four-fermion excitation continua. The
four-fermion dynamic quantities are of intermediate complexity between simple
two-fermion (like the zz dynamic structure factor) and enormously complex
multi-fermion (like the xx or xy dynamic structure factors) dynamic quantities.
Further we discuss the effects of dimerization, anisotropy of XY interaction,
and additional Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on various dynamic quantities.
Finally we consider the dynamic transverse spin structure factor
$S_{zz}({\bf{k}},\omega)$ for the s=1/2 XX model on a spatially anisotropic
square lattice which allows one to trace a one-to-two-dimensional crossover in
dynamic quantities.

4U 1728-34, 4U 1820-30 and 4U 1735-44) we investigate the relationship between
the observed fractional rms amplitudes of the twin kHz QPOs. We discuss whether
this displays features that could have a physical meaning in terms of the
proposed QPO models. METHOD: We consider the difference in rms amplitude
between the upper and lower kHz QPOs, as a function of the frequency ratio R.
We compare two data sets. Set I is a collection taken from published data. Set
II has rms amplitude values obtained by automatic fitting of continuous
segments of RXTE-PCA observations. RESULTS: For each of the six sources, we
find that there is a point in the R domain around which the amplitudes of the
two twin kHz QPOs are the same. We find such a point located inside a narrow
interval R=1.5 +-3%. Further investigation is needed in the case of two sources
to explore this finding, since we have not determined this point in Set II.
There is evidence of a similar point close to R = 1.33 or R = 1.25 in the four
sources. We suggest that some of these points may correspond to the documented
clustering of the twin kHz QPO frequency ratios. CONCLUSIONS: For the sources
studied, the rms amplitudes of the two kHz peaks become equal when the
frequencies of the oscillations pass through a certain ratio R, which is
roughly the same for each of the sources. In terms of the orbital QPO models,
with some assumptions concerning the QPO modulation, this finding implies the
existence of a specific orbit at a common value of the dimensionless radius, at
which the oscillations corresponding to the two peaks come into balance. In a
more general context, the amplitude difference behaviour suggests the possible
existence of an energy interchange between the upper and lower QPO modes.

brain injury (mTBI) are an open question. Possibilities include acceleration of
the head, direct passage of the blast wave via the cranium, and propagation of
the blast wave to the brain via a thoracic mechanism. The hypothesis that the
blast pressure wave reaches the brain via a thoracic mechanism is considered in
light of ballistic and blast pressure wave research. Ballistic pressure waves,
caused by penetrating ballistic projectiles or ballistic impacts to body armor,
can only reach the brain via an internal mechanism and have been shown to cause
cerebral effects. Similar effects have been documented when a blast pressure
wave has been applied to the whole body or focused on the thorax in animal
models. While vagotomy reduces apnea and bradycardia due to ballistic or blast
pressure waves, it does not eliminate neural damage in the brain, suggesting
that the pressure wave directly affects the brain cells via a thoracic
mechanism. An experiment is proposed which isolates the thoracic mechanism from
cranial mechanisms of mTBI due to blast wave exposure. Results have
implications for evaluating risk of mTBI due to blast exposure and for
developing effective protection.

'great walls' - the largest structures observed in the universe is suggested.
Although the basis of the model is the Zel'dovich approximation it has been
used in a new way very different from the previous studies. Instead of
traditional approach that evaluates the nonlinear density field it has been
utilized for identification of the regions in Lagrangian space that after the
mapping to real or redshift space (depending on the kind of structure is
studied) end up in the regions where shell-crossing occurs. The set of these
regions in Lagrangian space form the progenitor of the structure and after the
mapping it determines the pattern of the structure in real or redshift space.
The particle trajectories have crossed in such regions and the mapping is no
longer unique there. The progenitor after mapping makes only one stream in the
multi-stream flow regions therefore it does not comprise all the mass.
Nevertheless, it approximately retains the shape of the structure. The
progenitor of the structure in redshift space depends on a few non-Gaussian
fields and also it is strongly affected by two anisotropic fields that
determine the pattern of great walls as well as their huge sizes. All the
fields used in the mappings are derived from the linear potential smoothed at
the current scale of nonlinearity which is $R_{nl} = 2.7$ {\hmpc} for the
adopted parameters of the \lcdm universe normalized to $\sigma_8 = 0.8$. The
model predicts the existence of walls with sizes significantly greater than 500
{\hmpc} that may be found in sufficiently large redshift surveys.

beyond which the ice-albedo feedback causes the ice cover to melt away in an
irreversible process. The focus has typically been centered on the annual
minimum (September) ice cover, which is often seen as particularly susceptible
to destabilization by the ice-albedo feedback. Here we examine the central
physical processes associated with the transition from ice-covered to ice-free
Arctic Ocean conditions. We show that while the ice-albedo feedback promotes
the existence of multiple ice cover states, the stabilizing thermodynamic
effects of sea ice mitigate this when the Arctic Ocean is ice-covered during a
sufficiently large fraction of the year. These results suggest that critical
threshold behavior is unlikely during the approach from current perennial sea
ice conditions to seasonally ice-free conditions. In a further warmed climate,
however, we find that a critical threshold associated with the sudden loss of
the remaining wintertime-only sea ice cover may be likely.

the presence of a third `dark' component of energy, beyond matter and
radiation. The available data, however, are still deemed insufficient to
distinguish between an evolving dark energy component and the simplest model of
a time-independent cosmological constant. In this paper, we examine the
cosmological expansion in terms of observer-dependent coordinates, in addition
to the more conventional co-moving coordinates. This procedure explicitly
reveals the role played by the radius R_h of our cosmic horizon in the
interrogation of the data. (In Rindler's notation, R_h coincides with the
`event horizon' in the case of de Sitter, but changes in time for other
cosmologies that also contain matter and/or radiation.) With this approach, we
show that the interpretation of dark energy as a cosmological constant is
clearly disfavored by the observations. Within the framework of standard
Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmology, we derive an equation describing the
evolution of R_h, and solve it using the WMAP and Type Ia supernova data. In
particular, we consider the meaning of the observed equality (or near equality)
R_h(t_0) ~ ct_0, where t_0 is the age of the Universe. This empirical result is
far from trivial, for a cosmological constant would drive R_h(t) towards ct
(where t is the cosmic time) only once--and that would have to occur right now.
Though we are not here espousing any particular alternative model of dark
energy, for comparison we also consider scenarios in which dark energy is given
by scaling solutions, which simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in the
standard model, including the `coincidence' and `flatness' problems, and
account very well for the fact that R_h(t_0) ~ ct_0.

relations are used to identify potential jet breaks with characteristics
including the uniform jet model with and without lateral spreading and energy
injection, and a power-law structured jet model, all with a range of
parameters. With this technique, we survey the X-ray afterglows with strong
evidence for jet breaks (~12% of our sample), and reveal cases of potential jet
breaks that do not appear plainly from the light curve alone (another ~30%),
leading to insight into the missing jet break problem. Those X-ray light curves
that do not show breaks or have breaks that are not consistent with one of the
jet models are explored to place limits on the times of unseen jet breaks. The
distribution of jet break times ranges from a few hours to a few weeks with a
median of ~1 day, similar to what was found pre-Swift. On average Swift GRBs
have lower isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energies, which in turn results in
lower collimation corrected gamma-ray energies than those of pre-Swift GRBs.
Finally, we explore the implications for GRB jet geometry and energetics.

found to be larger than that of graphitic value while in zigzag tubes one bond
length has a constant value. These bond lengths are very sensitive to tube
radius. In chiral tubes, the value of bond length is found to depend on the
chirality and slightly on the tube radius. Different responses of these bond
lengths are found on application of pressure. At some critical pressure, both
bond lengths become equal to each other in achiral tubes. An analysis regarding

densities may exist in a crystalline color superconducting phase. These phases
are characterized by a gap parameter $\Delta$ that varies periodically in
space, forming a crystal structure. A Ginzburg-Landau expansion in $\Delta$
shows that two crystal structures based on cubic symmetry are particularly
favorable, and may be the ground state of matter at densities present in
neutron star cores. We derive the effective action for the phonon fields that
describe space- and time-dependent fluctuations of the crystal structure formed
by $\Delta$, and obtain the shear modulus from the coefficients of the spatial
derivative terms. Within a Ginzburg-Landau approximation, we find shear moduli
which are 20 to 1000 times larger than those of neutron star crusts. This phase
of matter is thus more rigid than any known material in the universe, but at
the same time the crystalline color superconducting phase is also superfluid.
These properties raise the possibility that the presence of this phase within
neutron stars may have distinct implications for their phenomenology. For
example, (some) pulsar glitches may originate in crystalline superconducting
neutron star cores.

pinning at the peak position of the PE and ending at the surface critical field
(H_c3). We have also observed the paramagnetic Meissner effect in field-cooled
magnetization data recorded at relatively large fields in this crystal. A

energy, that can be channeled in the form of ultrarelativistic jets. These jets
transport the energy from the collapsed core to large distances, where it is
dissipated in the form of long-duration gamma-ray bursts. In this paper we
study the dynamics of ultrarelativistic jets produced in collapsars. Also we
extrapolate our results to infer the angular energy distribution of the
produced outflows in the afterglow phase. Our main focus is to look for global
energetical properties which can be imprinted by the different structure of
different progenitor stars. Thus, we employ a number of pre-supernova, stellar
models (with distinct masses and metallicities), and inject in all of them jets
with fixed initial conditions. We assume that at the injection nozzle, the jet
is mildly relativistic (Lorentz factor $\sim 5$), has a finite half-opening
angle ($5^\circ$), and carries a power of $10^{51} $erg s$^{-1}$. These jets
arrive intact to the stellar surface and break out of it. A large Lorentz
factor region $\Gamma\simmore 100$ develops well before the jet reaches the
surface of the star, in the unshocked part of the beam, located between the
injection nozzle and the first recollimation shock. These high values of
$\Gamma$ are possible because the finite opening angle of the jet allows for
free expansion towards the radial direction. We find a strong correlation
between the angular energy distribution of the jet, after its eruption from the
progenitor surface, and the mass of the progenitors. The angular energy
distribution of the jets from light progenitor models is steeper than that of
the jets injected in more massive progenitor stars. This trend is also
imprinted in the angular distribution of isotropic equivalent energy.

length of the medium is small, all spatial cells oscillate synchronously,
reproducing the local hyperbolic dynamics. This regime is characterized by a
single positive Lyapunov exponent. The hyperbolicity survives when the system
gets larger in length so that the second Lyapunov exponent passes zero, and the
oscillations become inhomogeneous in space. However, at a point where the third
Lyapunov exponent becomes positive, some bifurcation occurs that results in
violation of the hyperbolicity due to the emergence of one-dimensional
intersections of contracting and expanding tangent subspaces along trajectories
on the attractor. Further growth of the length results in two-dimensional
intersections of expanding and contracting subspaces that we classify as a
stronger type of the violation. Beyond of the point of the hyperbolicity loss,
the system demonstrates an extensive spatiotemporal chaos typical for extended
chaotic systems: when the length of the system increases the Kaplan-Yorke

  Physics",,,,,"hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A detailed study is presented of the expected performance of the ATLAS
detector. The reconstruction of tracks, leptons, photons, missing energy and
jets is investigated, together with the performance of b-tagging and the
trigger. The physics potential for a variety of interesting physics processes,
within the Standard Model and beyond, is examined. The study comprises a series
of notes based on simulations of the detector and physics processes, with
particular emphasis given to the data expected from the first years of
operation of the LHC at CERN.
