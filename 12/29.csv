The upper bound was derived since a few years by general energy equipartition
arguments on observed solar particle flare. The lower bound, the most
compelling one for any guarantee neutrino signal, is derived by most recent
records of hard Gamma bump due to solar flare on January 2005 (by neutral pion
decay).The observed gamma flux reflects into a corresponding one for the
neutrinos, almost one to one. Therefore we obtain minimal bounds already at the
edge of present but quite within near future Megaton neutrino detectors. Such
detectors are considered mostly to reveal cosmic supernova background or rare
Local Group (few Mpc) Supernovas events. However Megaton or even inner ten
Megaton Ice Cube detector at ten GeV threshold may also reveal traces of solar
neutrino in hardest energy of solar flares. Icecube, marginally, too. Solar
neutrino flavors may shine light on neutrino mixing angles.

Despite the fact that electrons and holes behave like massless Dirac fermions,
the problem of BCS-like electron-hole pairing in graphene bilayer turns out to
be rather similar to that in usual coupled semiconductor quantum wells. The
distinctions are due to Berry phase of electronic wave functions and different
screening properties. We estimate values of the gap in one-particle excitation
spectrum for different interlayer distances and carrier concentrations.
Influence of disorder is discussed. At large enough dielectric susceptibility

\partial \v{E}/\partial t$ and the ordinary current $\v{J}$. I show that
$\epsilon_0 \partial \v{E}/\partial t$ contains a local term determined by the
present values of $\v{J}$ plus a non-local term determined by the retarded
values of $\v{J}$. The non-local term implements quantitatively the suggestion
made by Griffiths and Heald that the displacement current at a point is a
surrogate for ordinary currents at other locations.

an energy-based quasicontinuum approximation as the preconditioner.
  The analysis presented in this paper is used to determine an efficient
strategy for the parameter step size and number of iterations at each parameter
value to achieve a solution to a required tolerance. We present computational
results for the deformation of a Lennard-Jones chain under tension to
demonstrate the necessity of carefully applying continuation to ensure that the
computed solution remains in the domain of convergence of the iterative method
as the parameter is increased. These results exhibit fracture before the actual
load limit if the parameter step size is too large.

Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as a self-organizing and self-excitation
system, with two highly coupled processes. The first is the oscillation between
the two metastable warm (El Nino phase) and cold events (La Nina phase), and
the second is the spatiotemporal oscillation of the sea surface temperature
(SST) field. The interplay between these two processes gives rises the climate
variability associated with the ENSO, leads to both the random and
deterministic features of the ENSO, and defines a new natural feedback
mechanism, which drives the sporadic oscillation of the ENSO. The new mechanism
is rigorously derived using a dynamic transition theory developed recently by
the authors, which has also been successfully applied to a wide range of
problems in nonlinear sciences.

birth rates $\{\alpha_i\}$ and death rates $\{\beta_i\}$, where $\a_i\ge0$ and
$\b_i\ge0$ are polynomial functions of $i\in\ci$. The family includes Poisson,
negative binomial, binomial and hypergeometric distributions. In this paper, we
give probabilistic proofs of various Stein's factors for the PBD approximation
with $\a_i=a$ and $\b_i=i+bi(i-1)$ in terms of the Wasserstein distance. The
paper complements the work of Brown & Xia (2001) and generalizes the work of
Barbour & Xia (2006) where Poisson approximation ($b=0$) in the Wasserstein
distance is investigated. As an application, we establish an upper bound for
the Wasserstein distance between the PBD and Poisson binomial distribution and
show that the PBD approximation to the Poisson binomial distribution is much
more precise than the approximation by the Poisson or shifted Poisson
distributions.

undertakes a systematic study of satisfiability for LTL formulae over
restricted sets of propositional and temporal operators. Since every
propositional operator corresponds to a Boolean function, there exist
infinitely many propositional operators. In order to systematically cover all
possible sets of them, we use Post's lattice. With its help, we determine the
computational complexity of LTL satisfiability for all combinations of temporal
operators and all but two classes of propositional functions. Each of these
infinitely many problems is shown to be either PSPACE-complete, NP-complete, or

is not safe to reason about them using classical logic. The goal of Direct
Logic is to be a minimal fix to classical mathematical logic that meets the
requirements of large-scale Internet applications (including sense making for
natural language) by addressing the following issues: inconsistency robustness,
contrapositive inference bug, and direct argumentation.
  Direct Logic makes the following contributions over previous work:
  * Direct Inference (no contrapositive bug for inference)
  * Direct Argumentation (inference directly expressed)
  * Inconsistency-robust deduction without artifices such as indices (labels)
on propositions or restrictions on reiteration
  * Intuitive inferences hold including the following:
  * Boolean Equivalences
  * Reasoning by splitting for disjunctive cases
  * Soundness
  * Inconsistency-robust Proof by Contradiction
  Since the global state model of computation (first formalized by Turing) is
inadequate to the needs of modern large-scale Internet applications the Actor
Model was developed to meet this need. Using, the Actor Model, this paper
proves that Logic Programming is not computationally universal in that there
are computations that cannot be implemented using logical inference.
Consequently the Logic Programming paradigm is strictly less general than the
Procedural Embedding of Knowledge paradigm.

implementation presented, we used a basic Monte Carlo splitting and termination
method called the comb, incorporated the weight cancellation method of Arnow
{\it et al.}, and exploited a new sampling method, the sewing method, that does
a large state space sampling as a succession of small state space samplings. We
illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by its determination of the two
largest eigenvalues of the transfer matrices for variously-sized
two-dimensional, zero field Ising models. While very likely useful for other
transfer matrix problems, the algorithm is however quite general and should
find application to a larger variety of problems requiring a few dominant
eigenvalues of a matrix.

system shows flux variations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 0.7 mag and

covering the full orbital phase range were taken at the TWIN 3.5m telescope at
the Calar Alto Observatory (Alm\'{e}ria, Spain). These confirm the typical
PG1159 features seen in the SDSS discovery spectrum, together with the Balmer
series of hydrogen in emission (plus other emission lines), interpreted as
signature of the companion's irradiated side. A radial velocity curve was
obtained for both components. Using co-added radial-velocity-corrected spectra,
the spectral analysis of the PG1159 star is being refined.
  The system's lightcurve, obtained during three seasons of photometry with the
G\""ottingen 50cm and T\""ubingen 80cm telescopes, was fitted with both the
NIGHTFALL and PHOEBE binary simulation programs. An accurate mass determination
of the PG1159 component from the radial velocity measurements requires to first
derive the inclination, which requires light curve modelling and yields further
constraints on radii, effective temperature and separation of the system's
components. From the analysis of all data available so far, we present the
possible mass range for the PG1159 component of SDSSJ212531.92-010745.9.

with six-fold degenerate p orbitals can display bistable states, suitable for
application in high-density memory device with low power consumption. Due to
the inter-dot coupling of $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals in these QD arrays, two
dimensional conduction bands can be formed in the x-y plane, while the $p_z$
orbitals remain localized in the x-y plane such that the inter-dot coupling
between them can be neglected. We model such systems by taking into account the
on-site repulsive interactions between electrons in $p_z$ orbitals and the
coupling of the localized $p_z$ orbitals with the 2D conduction bands formed by
$p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals. The Green's function method within an extended
Anderson model is used to calculate the tunneling current through the QDs. We
find that bistable tunneling current can exist for such systems due to the
interplay of the on-site Coulomb interactions (U) between the $p_z$ orbitals
and the delocalized nature of conduction band states derived from the
hybridization of $p_x$ / $p_y$ orbitals. This bistable current is not sensitive
to the detailed band structure of the two dimensional band, but depends
critically on the strength of $U$ and the ratio of the left and right tunneling
rates. The behavior of the electrical bistability can be sustained when the 2D
QD array reduces to a one-dimensional QD array, indicating the feasibility for
high-density packing of these bistable nanoscale structures.

twisted by sudden crustal motions (""starquakes""). The twisted magnetosphere
does not remain static and gradually untwists, dissipating magnetic energy and
producing radiation. The equation describing this evolution is derived, and its
solutions are presented. Two distinct regions coexist in untwisting
magnetospheres: a potential region where curl(B)=0 (""cavity"") and a
current-carrying bundle of field lines (""j-bundle""). The cavity has a sharp
boundary, which expands with time and eventually erases all of the twist. In
this process, the electric current of the j-bundle is sucked into the star.
Observational appearance of the untwisting process is discussed. A hot spot
forms at the footprints of the j-bundle. The spot shrinks with time toward the
magnetic dipole axis, and its luminosity and temperature gradually decrease. As
the j-bundle shrinks, the amplitude of its twist can grow to the maximum
possible value ~ 1. The strong twist near the dipole axis increases the
spindown rate of the star and can generate a broad beam of radio emission. The
model explains the puzzling behavior of magnetar XTE J1810-197 -- a canonical
example of magnetospheric evolution following a starquake. We also discuss
implications for other magnetars. The untwisting theory suggests that the
nonthermal radiation of magnetars is preferentially generated on a bundle of
extended closed field lines near the dipole axis.

population synthesis tool with a highly improved near-IR extension, based on a
recent collection of empirical and theoretical spectra of red supergiant stars.
We obtain excellent fits across the near-IR with models at quasi-solar
metallicity and a solar neighbourhood extinction law. Spectroscopy breaks a
strong degeneracy between age and extinction in the near-IR colours in the red
supergiant-dominated phase of evolution. The estimated near-IR ages cluster
between 9 and 30 Myr, i.e. the ages at which the molecular bands due to
luminous red supergiants are strongest in the current models. They do not
always agree with optical spectroscopic ages. Adding optical data sometimes
leads to the rejection of the solar neighbourhood extinction law. This is not
surprising considering small-scale structure around the clusters, but it has no
significant effect on the near-IR based spectroscopic ages. [abridged]

speculates a duality between a large N strongly-coupled supersymmetric and

theory defined in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter AdS space-time. This review

for rigorous analysis of network properties? Networks exhibit a long list of
surprising properties: heavy tails for the degree distribution; small
diameters; and densification and shrinking diameters over time. Most present
network models either fail to match several of the above properties, are
complicated to analyze mathematically, or both. In this paper we propose a
generative model for networks that is both mathematically tractable and can
generate networks that have the above mentioned properties. Our main idea is to
use the Kronecker product to generate graphs that we refer to as ""Kronecker
graphs"".
  First, we prove that Kronecker graphs naturally obey common network
properties. We also provide empirical evidence showing that Kronecker graphs
can effectively model the structure of real networks.
  We then present KronFit, a fast and scalable algorithm for fitting the
Kronecker graph generation model to large real networks. A naive approach to
fitting would take super- exponential time. In contrast, KronFit takes linear

accurate parameters that indeed very well mimic the properties of target
networks. Once fitted, the model parameters can be used to gain insights about
the network structure, and the resulting synthetic graphs can be used for null-
models, anonymization, extrapolations, and graph summarization.

is based on the associated with Kerr theorem twistor structure which is defined
by an analytic curve $F(Z)=0$ in the projective twistor space $Z \in CP^3 .$ On
the other hand, there is a complex Newman representation which describes the
source of Kerr-Newman solution as a ""particle"" propagating along a complex
world-line $X(\t)\in CM^4,$ and this world-line determines the parameters of
the Kerr generating function $F(Z).$ The complex world line is really a
world-sheet, $\t= t + i \sigma,$ and the Kerr source may be considered as a
complex Euclidean string extended in the imaginary time direction $\sigma$. The
Kerr twistor structure turns out to be adjoined to the Kerr complex string
source, forming a natural twistor-string construction similar to the
Nair-Witten twistor-string. We show that twistor polarization of the
Kerr-Newman solution may be matched with the {\it massless} solutions of the
Dirac equation, providing consistency of the Dirac-Kerr model of spinning
particle (electron). It allows us to extend the Nair-Witten concept on the

turbulent fields, and are dynamically important. In the Milky Way, the total
field strength is about 6 $\mu$G near the Sun and several 100 $\mu$G in

determined in dependence on b. Such strong resonances could be relevant even in
sources with highly scattered resonant frequencies, as those expected in Sgr
A*. The specific values of a and b are given also for existence of specific
radius where \nu_K:\nu_{\theta}:\nu_r=s:t:u with 5>=s>t>u being small natural
numbers. It is shown that for some ratios such situation is impossible in the
field of black holes. We can conclude that analysing the microquasars
high-frequency QPOs in the framework of orbital resonance models, we can put
relevant limits on the tidal charge of brany Kerr black holes.
