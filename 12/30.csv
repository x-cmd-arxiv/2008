temperature: the toric-boson model. Although the coupling constants for the
bare model are not finite in the thermodynamic limit, the model has a finite

below which open strings are confined and therefore the lifetime of the memory
can be made arbitrarily (polynomially) long in system size. The interaction
with the bosonic field yields a long-range attractive force between the end
points of open strings but leaves closed strings and topological order intact.

Marangoni forces associated with the temperature dependence of the surface
tension, generate fluid convection in the sessile drop. Our results demonstrate
several dynamical stages of the convection characterized by different number of
vortices in the drop. During the early stage the street of vortices arises near
a surface of the drop and induces a non-monotonic spatial distribution of the
temperature over the drop surface. The initial number of near-surface vortices
in the drop is controlled by the Marangoni cell size which is similar to that
given by Pearson for flat fluid layers. This number quickly decreases with
time, resulting in three bulk vortices in the intermediate stage. The vortices
finally transform into the single convection vortex in the drop, existing
during about 1/2 of the evaporation time.

functions. All calculations are made in a Colombeau algebra, and the spinor
representations provided by the biquaternion formulation of classical
electrodynamics are used to make all four-dimensional integrations exactly and
in closed-form. The total rate of energy-momentum radiated by an arbitrarily
moving relativistic point-charge under the effect of its own field is shown to
be rigorously equal to minus the self-interaction force due to that field. This
solves, without changing anything in Maxwell's theory, numerous long-standing
problems going back to more than a century. As an immediate application an
unambiguous derivation of the Lorentz-Dirac equation of motion is given, and
the origin of the problem with the Schott term is explained: it was due to the
fact that the correct self-energy of a point charge is not the Coulomb
self-energy, but an integral over a delta-squared function which yields a
finite contribution to the Schott term that is either absent or incorrect in

discrete event systems, one often encounters the problem of solving the
equation Bf=g for a given vector g, where the same symbol B denotes the
corresponding max-plus linear operator, (Bf)_i:=max_j (b_{ij}+f_j). The matrix
B is said to be strongly regular when there exists a vector g such that the

that B is strongly regular if and only if the associated optimal assignment

first- and second-class constraints without appealing to any Poisson structure.
It is shown that the general local gauge dynamics can be equivalently
reformulated in the involutive normal form. The last form of dynamics always
admits the BRST embedding, which does not require the classical equations to
follow from any variational principle.

Trajectory, drag, and terminal performance depend strongly on velocity, and

presented for testing bullets at reduced velocities by loading the bullet into
a sabot and firing from a muzzle loading rifle with a suitably reduced powder
charge. Powder charges can be safely reduced to any desirable level when
shooting saboted bullets from a muzzleloader; in contrast, cartridge arms can
only be safely operated within a narrow window of powder charges/muzzle

a spin-polarized tip. It it shown that the tunneling conductance can be
partitioned into three separate contributions, a background conductance which
is independent of the local spin, a dynamical conductance which is proportional
to the local spin moment, and a conductance which is proportional to the noise
spectrum of the local spin interactions. The presented theory is applicable to
setups with magnetic tip and substrate in non-collinear arrangement, as well as
for non-magnetic situations. The partitioning of the tunneling current suggests
a possibility to extract the total spin moment of the local spin from the
dynamical conductance. The dynamical conductance suggests a possibility to
generate very high frequency spin-dependent ac currents and/or voltages. We
also propose a measurement of the dynamical conductance that can be used to
determine the character of the effective exchange interaction between
individual spins in clusters. The third contribution to the tunneling current
is associated with the spin-spin correlations induced by the exchange
interaction between the local spin moment and the tunneling electrons. We
demonstrate how this term can be used in the analysis of spin excitations
recorded in conductance measurements. Finally, we propose to use spin-polarized
scanning tunneling microscopy for detailed studies of the spin excitation
spectrum.

the edge states with two fields. We focus our attention on the four simplest
models of the edge states of a fluid with filling factor 2/3 and evaluate
charges and scaling dimensions of quasi-particles. We study transport through
an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer and show that scaling properties of
the Fourier components of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the current provide
information about the electric charges and scaling dimensions of
quasi-particles. Thus Mach-Zehnder interferometers can be used to discriminate
between different effective models of fluids corresponding to the same filling
factor. They therefore can be used to test fundamental postulates underlying
the low-energy effective theory of edge states. An important ingredient of our
analysis is the tunneling Hamiltonian of quasi-particles, the form of which is

bootstrap key pre-distribution. Our secure initialization method requires only
a little extra cost, is efficient and scalable with respect to the number of

an anomalous excess of mass can also be associated with a deviation from the
classical gravitomagnetic Larmor theorem due to the presence of dark energy in
the superconductor, as well as with the discrete structure of the area of the
superconducting Niobium ring as predicted by Loop Quantum Gravity. From Cabrera
and Tate measurements we deduce that the quantization of spacetime in
superconducting circular rings occurs at the Planck-Einstein scale $l_{PE} =
(\hbar G/c^3 \Lambda)^{1/4}\sim 3.77\times 10 ^{-5} m$, instead of the Planck
scale $l_{P} =(\hbar G / c^3)^{1/2}=1.61 \times 10 ^{-35} m$, with an Immirzi
parameter which depends on the specific critical temperature of the
superconducting material and on the area of the ring. The stephan-Boltzmann law
for quantized areas delimited by superconducting rings is predicted, and an

dark energy in superconductors.

have accreted slowly, in more than 10^5 yr, and in a low pressure, low gas
density environment. Gravitational interactions between the satellites and the
gas disk lead to inward orbital migration and loss of satellites to Jupiter.
Such effects tend to select for a maximum satellite mass and a common total
satellite system mass compared to the planet's mass. One implication is that
multiple satellite systems may have formed and been lost during the final

generation that survived as gas inflow to Jupiter ended. We conclude by

publications in the field of phylogenetics rarely do this. Such analyses
discard fundamental aspects of science as prescribed by Karl Popper. Indeed,
not without cause, Popper (1978) once argued that evolutionary biology was
unscientific as its hypotheses were untestable. Here we trace developments in
assessing fit from Penny et al. (1982) to the present. We compare the general
log-likelihood ratio (the G or G2 statistic) statistic between the evolutionary
tree model and the multinomial model with that of marginalized tests applied to
an alignment (using placental mammal coding sequence data). It is seen that the
most general test does not reject the fit of data to model (p~0.5), but the
marginalized tests do. Tests on pair-wise frequency (F) matrices, strongly (p <
0.001) reject the most general phylogenetic (GTR) models commonly in use. It is
also clear (p < 0.01) that the sequences are not stationary in their nucleotide
composition. Deviations from stationarity and homogeneity seem to be unevenly
distributed amongst taxa; not necessarily those expected from examining other
regions of the genome. By marginalizing the 4t patterns of the i.i.d. model to
observed and expected parsimony counts, that is, from constant sites, to
singletons, to parsimony informative characters of a minimum possible length,
then the likelihood ratio test regains power, and it too rejects the
evolutionary model with p << 0.001. Given such behavior over relatively recent
evolutionary time, readers in general should maintain a healthy skepticism of
results, as the scale of the systematic errors in published analyses may really

the formulation for higher dimensional systems is invariant under permutation

firstly a \textit{k}-nearest neighbor (knn) graph as a weighted and directed
graph is produced among all data points in a dataset each of which is regarded
as an agent who can move in space, and then a time-varying complex network is
created by adding long-range links for each data point. Furthermore, each data
point is not only acted by its \textit{k} nearest neighbors but also \textit{r}
long-range neighbors through fields established in space by them together, so
it will take a step along the direction of the vector sum of all fields. It is
more important that these long-range links provides some hidden information for
each data point when it moves and at the same time accelerate its speed
converging to a center. As they move in space according to the proposed model,
data points that belong to the same class are located at a same position
gradually, whereas those that belong to different classes are away from one
another. Consequently, the experimental results have demonstrated that data
points in datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the rates of
convergence of clustering algorithms are fast enough. Moreover, the comparison

nanotubes and silicon nanowires. The method is derived by using a statistical
approach within the second quantization formalism and allows to include both
the effects of Pauli exclusion and Coulomb repulsion among charge carriers. In
this way it extends Landauer-Buttiker approach by explicitly including the
effect of Coulomb repulsion on noise. We implement the method through the
self-consistent solution of the 3D Poisson and transport equations within the
NEGF framework and a Monte Carlo procedure for populating injected electron
states. We show that the combined effect of Pauli and Coulomb interactions
reduces shot noise in strong inversion down to 23 % of the full shot noise for

numerically investigated. From the molecular dynamics simulation for colliding
two identical clusters, it is found that the restitution coefficient for
head-on collisions has a peak at a colliding speed due to the competition
between the cohesive interaction and the repulsive interaction of colliding
clusters. Some aspects of the collisions can be understood by the theory by
Brilliantov {\it et al.} (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 76}, 051302 (2007)), but many new
aspects are found from the simulation. In particular, we find that there are
some anomalous rebounds in which the restitution coefficient is larger than
unity. The phase diagrams of rebound processes against impact speed and the
cohesive parameter can be understood by a simple phenomenology.

\rho\pi$ is very small while the $\rho-\pi$ channel is a main one in $J/\psi$
decays. To understand the puzzle, various interpretations have been proposed.
Meanwhile according to the hadronic helicity selection rule the decay mode
$J/\psi\to\rho\pi$ should be suppressed, but definitely, numerical computation
is needed to determine how it is suppressed. We calculate the branching ratios
corresponding to subprocesses $J/\psi\to ggg\to\rho\pi$ and $\to ggg\to\pi\pi$
in the framework of QCD. The results show that the branching ratios are
proportional to $({m_u+m_d\over M_{J/\psi}})^2$ for $\rho\pi$ mode and
$({m_u-m_d\over M_{J/\psi}})^2$ for $\pi\pi$ mode which is an isospin-violation
channel. If only the OZI process is considered, the theoretical prediction on
the ratio of $J/\psi\to \rho\pi$ is smaller than data, but not too drastically
small. Meanwhile, a possible interpretation for the $\rho\pi$ puzzle is
proposed that the suppression is due to interference between OZI and
electromagnetic (EM) contributions. Thus based on this observation, we suggest
that if the amplitudes of the strong OZI process via an s-channel three-gluon
intermediate state and electromagnetic one via an s-channel virtual photon
intermediate state have the same order of magnitude, and constructively
interfere for $J/\psi\to\rho\pi$, but destructively interfere for
$\psi'\to\rho\pi$, thus simultaneously the $\rho\pi$ puzzle disappears and the
sizable width of $J/\psi\to\rho\i$ is understandable. However, so far, we
cannot derive the phase difference from an underlying principle of QCD yet.
Alternative interpretations are also discussed in the text.

decoding the receiver must share a reference frame with the sender. Indeed, if
the receiver only possesses a bounded-size quantum token of the sender's
reference frame, then the decoding is imperfect, and we can describe this
effect as a noisy quantum channel. We seek here to characterize the performance
of such schemes, or equivalently, to determine the effective decoherence
induced by having a bounded-size reference frame. We assume that the token is
prepared in a special state that has particularly nice group-theoretic
properties and that is near-optimal for transmitting information about the
sender's frame. We present a decoding operation, which can be proven to be
near-optimal in this case, and we demonstrate that there are two distinct ways
of implementing it (corresponding to two distinct Kraus decompositions). In
one, the receiver measures the orientation of the reference frame token and
reorients the system appropriately. In the other, the receiver extracts the
encoded information from the virtual subsystems that describe the relational
degrees of freedom of the system and token. Finally, we provide explicit
characterizations of these decoding schemes when the system is a single qubit

to circular quantum ring potentials. We find that the pinning by weak defects
is only allowed when the symmetry of the classical few-electron lowest-energy
configuration agrees with the symmetry of the external potential. We indicate
that whenever the pinning is allowed by the symmetry, its strength is an
oscillatory function of the external magnetic field. In the magnetic fields for
which the pinning is maximal the dipole moment generated by the persistent
currents changes orientation from antiparallel to parallel to the external
field in a continuous manner. For confinement potentials of a higher symmetry
than the one of a classical Wigner molecule the pinning is forbidden and a
discontinuous abrupt inversion of the dipole moments is observed. When the
pinning of single-electron islands is absent or weak the current distribution
resembles the one of a circular ring. For the maximal pinning instead of
current loops running around the entire ring one observes formation of multiple
current vortices circulating around each single-electron density island. We
study the magnetic field generated by persistent currents and find that at the
dipole moment reversal the currents tend to screen the external field in the
region occupied by electrons. In consequence the magnetic field generated by
the currents in the maximally pinned electron systems maps the charge
distribution.

qualitative differences from tunneling into s-wave or d-wave superconductors

a suppression of Andreev reflection in the case of a highly transparent N/S

bound states may appear, both at zero and at non-zero energies. These effects
do not occur in multiband superconductors without interband sign reversal,
though the interference can still strongly modify the conductance spectra.

numerical simulations under quasistatic triaxial compression. The Contact
Dynamics method is used for this investigation with 40 000 particles. The
effect of particle shape is analyzed by comparing this packing with a packing
of similar particle size distribution but with spherical particles. We analyze
the origin of the higher shear strength of the polyhedra packing by considering
various anisotropy parameters characterizing the microstructure and force
transmission. Remarkably, we find that the polyhedra packing has a lower fabric
anisotropy in terms of branch vectors (joining the particle centers) than the
sphere packing. In contrast, the polyhedra packing shows a much higher force
anisotropy which is at the origin of its higher shear strength. The force
anisotropy in the polyhedra packing is shown to be related to the formation of
face-face contacts. In particular, most face-face contacts belong to strong
force chains along the major principal stress direction whereas vertex-face and
edge-edge contacts are correlated with weak forces and oriented on average
along the minor principal stress direction in steady shearing.

procedures (TISP) for model selection and shrinkage. People have long before
noticed the weakness of the convex $l_1$-constraint (or the soft-thresholding)
in wavelets and have designed many different forms of nonconvex penalties to
increase model sparsity and accuracy. But for a nonorthogonal regression
matrix, there is great difficulty in both investigating the performance in
theory and solving the problem in computation. TISP provides a simple and
efficient way to tackle this so that we successfully borrow the rich results in
the orthogonal design to solve the nonconvex penalized regression for a general
design matrix. Our starting point is, however, thresholding rules rather than
penalty functions. Indeed, there is a universal connection between them. But a
drawback of the latter is its non-unique form, and our approach greatly
facilitates the computation and the analysis. In fact, we are able to build the
convergence theorem and explore theoretical properties of the selection and
estimation via TISP nonasymptotically. More importantly, a novel Hybrid-TISP is
proposed based on hard-thresholding and ridge-thresholding. It provides a
fusion between the $l_0$-penalty and the $l_2$-penalty, and adaptively achieves
the right balance between shrinkage and selection in statistical modeling. In
practice, Hybrid-TISP shows superior performance in test-error and is
parsimonious.

an edge-removing-and-rewiring (ERR) function is employed to explore in a

small payoffs, and creates new edges to neighbors with larger payoffs. As such,
the connections among data points vary over time. During the evolution of

in the presence of the positive cosmological constant and radiation is studied.
For analysis of tunneling probability for birth of an asymptotically deSitter,
inflationary Universe as a function of the radiation energy a new definition of
a ""free"" wave propagating inside strong fields is proposed. On such a basis,
tunneling boundary condition is corrected, penetrability and reflection
concerning to the barrier are calculated in fully quantum stationary approach.
For the first time non-zero interference between the incident and reflected
waves has been taken into account which turns out to play important role inside
cosmological potentials and could be explained by non-locality of barriers in
quantum mechanics. Inside whole region of energy of radiation the tunneling
probability for the birth of the inflationary Universe is found to be close to
its value obtained in semiclassical approach. The reflection from the barrier
is determined for the first time (which is essentially differs on 1 at the
energy of radiation close to the barrier height). The proposed method could be
easily generalized on the cosmological models with the barriers of arbitrary
shape, that has been demonstrated for the FRW-model with included Chaplygin
gas. Result is stable for variations of the studied barriers, accuracy are
found to be 11--18 digits for all coefficients and energies below the barrier
height.

redshifts of galaxies on cosmological parameter estimates with cosmic shear
tomography. We consider a fiducial survey with 9-filter set and perform photo-z
measurement simulations. It is found that a fraction of 1% galaxies at
z_{spec}~0.4 is misidentified to be at z_{phot}~3.5. We then employ both chi^2
fitting method and the extension of Fisher matrix formalism to evaluate the
bias on the equation of state parameters of dark energy, w_0 and w_a, induced
by those catastrophic outliers. By comparing the results from both methods, we
verify that the estimation of w_0 and w_a from the fiducial 5-bin tomographic
analyses can be significantly biased. To minimize the impact of this bias, two
strategies can be followed: (A) the cosmic shear analysis is restricted to
0.5<z<2.5 where catastrophic redshift errors are expected to be insignificant;
(B) a spectroscopic survey is conducted for galaxies with 3<z_{phot}<4. We find
that the number of spectroscopic redshifts needed scales as N_{spec} \propto
f_{cata}\times A where f_{cata}=1% is the fraction of catastrophic redshift
errors (assuming a 9-filter photometric survey) and A is the survey area. For
A=1000 {deg}^2, we find that N_{spec}>320 and 860 respectively in order to
reduce the joint bias in (w_0,w_a) to be smaller than 2\sigma and 1\sigma. This
spectroscopic survey (option B) will improve the Figure of Merit of option A by
a factor \times 1.5 thus making such a survey strongly desirable.

and solved efficiently using generic solvers scalable to large networks. We
report promising results on recovering simulated time-varying networks. For
real data sets, we reverse engineer the latent sequence of temporally rewiring

coupled to abelian gauge fields has been proposed as a gravity dual for
Lifshitz like critical phenomena in 2+1 dimensions. The finite temperature
behavior is described by black holes that are asymptotic to the Lifshitz fixed
point geometry. There is a one-parameter family of charged black holes, where
the magnitude of the charge is uniquely determined by the black hole area.
These black holes are thermodynamically stable and become extremal in the limit
of vanishing size. The theory also has a discrete spectrum of localized objects
described by non-singular spacetime geometries. The finite temperature behavior
of Wilson loops is reminiscent of strongly coupled gauge theories in 3+1
dimensions, including screening at large distances.
