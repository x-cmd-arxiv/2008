recombination on the hydrodynamics of core-collapse supernovae. Our focus is on
the non-linear dynamics of the shock wave that forms in the collapse, and the
assembly of positive energy material below it. To this end, we perform
time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations with FLASH2.5 in spherical and axial
symmetry. These generalize our previous calculations by allowing for bulk
neutrino heating and for nuclear statistical equilibrium between n, p and
alpha. The heating rate is freely tunable, as is the starting radius of the
shock relative to the recombination radius of alpha-particles. An explosion in
spherical symmetry involves the excitation of an overstable mode, which may be
viewed as the L=0 version of the `Standing Accretion Shock Instability'. In 2D
simulations, non-spherical deformations of the shock are driven by plumes of
material with positive Bernoulli parameter, which are concentrated well outside
the zone of strong neutrino heating. The non-spherical modes of the shock reach
a large amplitude only when the heating rate is also high enough to excite
convection below the shock. The critical heating rate that causes an explosion
depends sensitively on the initial position of the shock relative to the
recombination radius. Weaker heating is required to drive an explosion in 2D
than in 1D, but the difference also depends on the size of the shock. Forcing
the infalling heavy nuclei to break up into n and p below the shock only causes
a slight increase in the critical heating rate, except when the shock starts
out at a large radius. This shows that heating by neutrinos (or some other
mechanism) must play a significant role in pushing the shock far enough out
that recombination heating takes over.

singularity. This calculation can be done in three different ways: i) the
direct approach where one monitors the blowing-up quantity as it approaches the
singularity and uses the data to calculate the blow-up rate ; ii) the ""phase
transition"" approach (\`a la Wilson) where one treats the singularity as a
fixed point of the renormalization flow equation and proceeds to compute the
blow-up rate via an analysis in the vicinity of the fixed point and iii) the
""scaling"" approach (\`a la Widom-Kadanoff) where one postulates the existence
of scaling laws for different quantities close to the singularity, computes the
associated exponents and then uses them to estimate the blow-up rate. Our
algorithm allows a unified presentation of these three approaches. The inviscid
Burgers equation and the supercritical Schrodinger equation are used as
instructive examples to illustrate the constructions.

corresponding to the deflected free surface are possible in this case. Linear
analysis in the case of tilted vibration shows that either stabilization or

replaced by groupoids, and linear operators are replaced by spans of groupoids.
We introduce this idea with a detailed exposition of 'degroupoidification': a
systematic process that turns groupoids and spans into vector spaces and linear
operators. Then we present two applications of groupoidification. The first is
to Feynman diagrams. The Hilbert space for the quantum harmonic oscillator
arises naturally from degroupoidifying the groupoid of finite sets and
bijections. This allows for a purely combinatorial interpretation of creation
and annihilation operators, their commutation relations, field operators, their
normal-ordered powers, and finally Feynman diagrams. The second application is
to Hecke algebras. We explain how to groupoidify the Hecke algebra associated
to a Dynkin diagram whenever the deformation parameter q is a prime power. We
illustrate this with the simplest nontrivial example, coming from the A2 Dynkin
diagram. In this example we show that the solution of the Yang-Baxter equation
built into the A2 Hecke algebra arises naturally from the axioms of projective
geometry applied to the projective plane over the finite field with q elements.

supermassive black holes would have many important implications. For example,
it would provide new information about gas and magnetic field interactions in
dynamical spacetimes as well as a combination of redshift and luminosity
distance that would enable precise cosmological tests. A proposal first made by
Bode & Phinney (2007) is that because radiation of gravitational waves during
the final inspiral and merger of the holes is abrupt and decreases the mass of
the central object by a few percent, there will be waves in the disk that can
steepen into shocks and thus increase the disk luminosity in a characteristic
way. We evaluate this process analytically and numerically. We find that shocks
only occur when the fractional mass loss exceeds the half-thickness (h/r) of
the disk, hence significant energy release only occurs for geometrically thin
disks which are thus at low Eddington ratios. This strongly limits the
effective energy release, and in fact our simulations show that the natural
variations in disk luminosity are likely to obscure this effect entirely.
However, we demonstrate that the reduction of luminosity caused by the retreat
of the inner edge of the disk following mass loss is potentially detectable.
This decrease occurs even if the disk is geometrically thick, and lasts for a
duration on the order of the viscous time of the modified disk.
Observationally, the best prospect for detection would be a sensitive future
X-ray instrument with a field of view of on the order of a square degree, or
possibly a wide-field radio array such as the Square Kilometer Array, if the
disk changes produce or interrupt radio emission from a jet.

incomplete, and to ask whether the true equilibrium state of an ideal gas may

compensate for the loss of energy by radiation into the cosmos. An experiment

was first noted by Pauling in 1931. His point became moot, however, with the
success of the ionic picture of Van Vleck, where ligands influence magnetic
electrons of 3d ions mainly through electrostatic fields. Anderson's theory of
spin superexchange later established that covalency is at the heart of
cooperative magnetism in insulators, but its energy scale was believed to be
small compared to other inter-ionic interactions and therefore it was
considered a small perturbation of the ionic picture. This assertion fails
dramatically in copper oxides, which came to prominence following the discovery
of high critical temperature superconductors (HTSC). Magnetic interactions in
cuprates are remarkably strong and are often considered the origin of the
unusually high superconducting transition temperature, Tc. Here we report a
detailed survey of magnetic excitations in the one-dimensional cuprate Sr2CuO3
using inelastic neutron scattering (INS). We show that although the
experimental dynamical spin structure factor is well described by the model
S=1/2 nearest-neighbour Heisenberg Hamiltonian typically used for cuprates, the
magnetic intensity is modified dramatically by strong hybridization of Cu 3d
states with O p states, showing that the ionic picture of localized 3d
Heisenberg spin magnetism is grossly inadequate. Our findings provide a natural
explanation for the puzzle of the missing INS magnetic intensity in cuprates
and have profound implications for understanding current and future
experimental data on these materials.

AdS/QCD models are generally more accurate than should have been expected.
Certain predictions based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, such as the ratio of
the equilibrium viscosity to entropy density, are universal and therefore
provide firm experimental tests of these models. Other observables, while not
completely universal, may be relatively insensitive to model details. We
calculate the dependence of a number of low-energy hadronic observables on
details of the hard-wall AdS/QCD model. In particular, we vary the infrared
boundary conditions, the 5D gauge coupling, and the mass of the field
responsible for chiral symmetry breaking, while holding fixed a small number of
observables. We also find a generalized Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation which

starting from an asymptotically AdS_5 spacetime where the speed of light,

deep in the interior. This example follows the general plan of earlier work on
superconducting black holes. To obtain a normalizable, four-dimensional
graviton, one can introduce a Planck brane whose action includes a wrong-sign
Einstein-Hilbert term. The equation of state of the Planck brane has w < -1,
which is a violation of the null energy condition. I show, in an almost
dimension-independent fashion, that such a violation must occur in a static
time warp geometry. Time warps of the type I describe provide an
extra-dimensional description of boost invariance as an emergent symmetry in
the infrared. High-energy violations of Lorentz symmetry, if confined to a
strongly coupled unparticle sector dual to the time warp geometry, might
manifest themselves through unusual kinematic constraints. As an example, I
explain how modifications of unparticle phase space would affect the decay of a
heavy particle into a light visible sector particle plus unparticle stuff.

distributions (SEDs) of these model LBGs are then analysed by fitting galaxy
template SEDs derived from stellar population synthesis models with smoothly
declining SFRs. We compare the statistical properties of LBGs' physical
parameters -- such as stellar mass, SFR, and stellar population age -- as
derived from the best-fit galaxy templates with the intrinsic values from the
semi-analytic model. We find some trends in these distributions: first, when
the redshift is known, SED-fitting methods reproduce the input distributions of
LBGs' stellar masses relatively well, with a minor tendency to underestimate
the masses overall, but with substantial scatter. Second, there are large
systematic biases in the distributions of best-fit SFRs and mean ages, in the
sense that single-component SED-fitting methods underestimate SFRs and
overestimate ages. We attribute these trends to the different star formation
histories predicted by the semi-analytic models and assumed in the galaxy
templates used in SED-fitting procedure, and to the fact that light from the
current generation of star-formation can hide older generations of stars. These
biases, which arise from the SED-fitting procedure, can significantly affect
inferences about galaxy evolution from broadband photometry.

the absolute age of nodes (ancestors) and molecular estimates that give us
estimates of the relative ages of nodes in a molecular evolutionary tree. Both
forms of data are often best characterized as yielding continuous probability
distributions on nodes. Here, the distributions modeling older fossil
calibrations within the tree of placental (eutherian) mammals are reconsidered.
In particular the Horse/Rhino, Human/Tarsier, Whale/ Hippo, Rabbit/Pika and
Rodentia calibrations are reexamined and adjusted. Inferring the relative ages
of nodes in a phylogeny also requires the assumption of a model of evolutionary
rate change across the tree. Here nine models of evolutionary rate change, are
combined with various continuous distributions modeling fossil calibrations.
Fit of model is measured both relative to a normalized fit, which assumes that
all models fit well in the absence of multiple fossil calibrations, and also by
the linearity of their residuals. The normalized fit used attempts to track
twice the log likelihood difference from the best expected model. The results
suggest there is a very large difference in the age of the root proposed by
calibrations in Supraprimates (informally Euarchontoglires) versus
Laurasiatheria. Combining both sets of calibrations results in the penalty
function vastly increasing in all cases. These issues remain irrespective of

conditional distribution of the tests outcomes given the latent process depends
on these abilities through a multidimensional two-parameter logistic

on the dimensionality of the model and on the transition matrices of the latent

super-Eddington luminosities to quiescence. The X-ray color evolution first
resembles the Cyg X-2 subgroup of Z sources, with frequent excursions on the
horizontal and normal branches (HB/NB). The source then decays and evolves to
the Sco X-1 subgroup, with increasing focus on the flaring branch (FB) and the
lower vertex of the ""Z"". Finally, the FB subsides, and the source transforms
into an atoll source, with the lower vertex evolving to the atoll soft state.
Spectral analyses suggest that the atoll stage is characterized by a constant
inner disk radius, while the Z stages exhibit a luminosity-dependent expansion
of the inner disk, which we interpret as effects related to the local Eddington
limit. Contrary to the view that the mass accretion rate ($\dot{m}$) changes
along the Z, we find that changes in $\dot{m}$ are instead responsible for the
secular evolution of the Z and the subclasses. Motion along the Z branches
appears to be caused by three different mechanisms that may operate at roughly
constant $\dot{m}$. For the Sco X-1-like Z stage, we find that the FB is an
instability track that proceeds off the lower vertex when the inner disk radius
shrinks from the value set by the X-ray luminosity toward the value measured
for the atoll soft state. Excursions up the NB occur when the apparent size of
the boundary layer increases while the disk exhibits little change. The HB is
associated with Comptonization of the disk emission. The Z branches for the Cyg
X-2-like stage are more complicated, and their origin is unclear. Finally, our
spectral results lead us to hypothesize that the lower and upper Z vertices
correspond to a standard thin disk and a slim disk, respectively.

concentrated in sunspot regions and causes numerous active phenomena on the
Sun. This paper discusses some properties of the emerging magnetic flux
observed on the solar surface and in the interior. A statistical analysis of
variations of the tilt angle of bipolar magnetic regions during the emergence
shows that the systematic tilt with respect to the equator (the Joy's law) is
most likely established below the surface. However, no evidence of the
dependence of the tilt angle on the amount of emerging magnetic flux, predicted
by the rising magnetic flux rope theories, is found. Analysis of surface plasma
flows in a large emerging active region reveals strong localized upflows and
downflows at the initial phase of emergence but finds no evidence for
large-scale flows indicating future appearance a large-scale magnetic
structure. Local helioseismology provides important tools for mapping
perturbations of the wave speed and mass flows below the surface. Initial
results from SOHO/MDI and GONG reveal strong diverging flows during the flux
emergence, and also localized converging flows around stable sunspots. The wave
speed images obtained during the process of formation of a large active region,

with the aim of achieving distributability. As our system model we use Petri
nets. In Petri nets, an inherent concept of simultaneity is built in, since
when a transition has more than one preplace, it can be crucial that tokens are
removed instantaneously. When modelling a system which is intended to be
implemented in a distributed way by a Petri net, this built-in concept of
synchronous interaction may be problematic. To investigate this we consider
asynchronous implementations of nets, in which removing tokens from places can
no longer be considered as instantaneous. We model this by inserting silent
(unobservable) transitions between transitions and some of their preplaces. We
investigate three such implementations, differing in the selection of preplaces
of a transition from which the removal of a token is considered time consuming,
and the possibility of collecting the tokens in a given order.
  We investigate the effect of these different transformations of instantaneous
interaction into asynchronous interaction patterns by comparing the behaviours
of nets before and after insertion of the silent transitions. We exhibit for
which classes of Petri nets we obtain equivalent behaviour with respect to
failures equivalence.
  It turns out that the resulting hierarchy of Petri net classes can be
described by semi-structural properties. For two of the classes we obtain
precise characterisations; for the remaining class we obtain lower and upper
bounds.

We investigate to what extent or under which conditions synchronous interaction
is a valid concept for specification and implementation of such systems. We
choose Petri nets as our system model and consider different notions of
distribution by associating locations to elements of nets. First, we
investigate the concept of simultaneity which is inherent in the semantics of
Petri nets when transitions have multiple input places. We assume that tokens
may only be taken instantaneously by transitions on the same location. We
exhibit a hierarchy of `asynchronous' Petri net classes by different
assumptions on possible distributions. Alternatively, we assume that the
synchronisations specified in a Petri net are crucial system properties. Hence
transitions and their preplaces may no longer placed on separate locations. We
then answer the question which systems may be implemented in a distributed way
without restricting concurrency, assuming that locations are inherently
sequential. It turns out that in both settings we find semi-structural
properties of Petri nets describing exactly the problematic situations for
interactions in distributed systems.

Coulomb, electron-hole Coulomb, electron-hole exchange (the Bir-Aronov-Pikus
mechanism) and the $s$-$d$ exchange scatterings, are explicitly included. The
Elliot-Yafet mechanism is also incorporated. From this approach, we study the
spin relaxation in both $n$-type and $p$-type Ga(Mn)As quantum wells. For
$n$-type Ga(Mn)As quantum wells where most Mn ions take the interstitial
positions, we find that the spin relaxation is always dominated by the DP
mechanism in metallic region. Interestingly, the Mn concentration dependence of
the spin relaxation time is nonmonotonic and exhibits a peak. This behavior is
because that the momentum scattering and the inhomogeneous broadening have
different density dependences in the non-degenerate and degenerate regimes. For
$p$-type Ga(Mn)As quantum wells, we find that Mn concentration dependence of
the spin relaxation time is also nonmonotonic and shows a peak. Differently,
this behavior is because that the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering (or the
Bir-Aronov-Pikus) mechanism dominates the spin relaxation in the high Mn
concentration regime at low (or high) temperature, whereas the DP mechanism
determines the spin relaxation in the low Mn concentration regime. The
Elliot-Yafet mechanism also contributes the spin relaxation at intermediate
temperature. The spin relaxation time due to the DP mechanism increases with Mn
concentration due to motional narrowing, whereas those due to the spin-flip
mechanisms decrease with Mn concentration, which thus leads to the formation of
the peak.... (The remaining is omitted due to the space limit)

most frequently in the characterization of fundamental limits in various
scenarios involving multiple users. Examples include classical settings in
network information theory such as Slepian-Wolf source coding and multiple
access channels, classical settings in statistics such as robust hypothesis
testing, and new settings at the intersection of networking and statistics such
as distributed estimation problems for sensor networks. Cooperative game theory
allows one to understand aspects of all of these problems from a fresh and
unifying perspective that treats users as players in a game, sometimes leading
to new insights. At the heart of these analyses are fundamental dualities that
have been long studied in the context of cooperative games; for information
theoretic purposes, these are dualities between information inequalities on the
one hand and properties of rate, capacity or other resource allocation regions
on the other.

arising in many fields, from the social and physical sciences to economics.
Recently, as the definition of information is generalized to include entangled
quantum systems, quantum game theory has emerged as a framework for
understanding the competitive flow of quantum information. Up till now only
two-player quantum games have been demonstrated. Here we report the first
experiment that implements a four-player quantum Minority game over tunable
four-partite entangled states encoded in the polarization of single photons.
Experimental application of appropriate quantum player strategies give
equilibrium payoff values well above those achievable in the classical game.
These results are in excellent quantitative agreement with our theoretical
analysis of the symmetric Pareto optimal strategies. Our result demonstrate for
the first time how non-trivial equilibria can arise in a competitive situation
involving quantum agents and pave the way for a range of quantum transaction
applications.

procedure based on the helical and rotational symmetry for atom coordinates
generation, coupled with Tersoff potential for interaction energy calculations.
Results show that the structure of zigzag tubes is governed by two bond
lengths. One bond length is found to have a value equal to that of graphite,
while the other one is larger. Furthermore, the tube length is found to have
significant effect only on larger bond length in zigzag tubes. With the
application of the pressure, only the larger bond length compresses, the other
one remaining practically constant. At some critical pressure, this bond length
becomes equal to constant bond length. This behavior of bond lengths is
different from those of armchair tubes. An analysis regarding the cross
sectional shape has also been done. At some higher pressure, transition from
circular to oval cross section takes place. This transition pressure is found
to be equal 2.06GPa for (20,0) tube. Some comparison with chiral tubes has also

two qubit gate in a fixed coupling scheme. A phenomenological model for the
spatial and cross-talk correlations is introduced. The decoherence inside the
SWAP subspace is analysed by combining analytic results based on the adiabatic
approximation and numerical simulations. Results critically depend on amplitude
of the low frequency noise with respect to the qubits coupling strength.
Correlations between noise sources induce qualitative different behaviors
depending on the values of the above parameters. The possibility to reduce
dephasing due to correlated low frequency noise by a recalibration protocol is
discussed.

information about the multifractal exponents for multifractal quantum states.
We show that, combined with quantum simulation algorithms, it enables to build
quantum algorithms for multifractal exponents with a polynomial gain compared
to classical simulations. Numerical results indicate that a rough estimate of
fractality could be obtained exponentially fast. Our findings are relevant e.g.
for quantum simulations of multifractal quantum maps and of the Anderson model
at the metal-insulator transition.
